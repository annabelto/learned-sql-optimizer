# Query 1
# print("To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply a series of data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the steps and the rules applied:\n\n### 1. Predicate Pushdown\n**Rule Applied:** Move the filter condition (`WHERE` clause) as close as possible to the data retrieval operation. This reduces the number of rows processed in the subsequent steps of the query.\n\n**Original Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT l_returnflag, l_linestatus, \n       SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, \n       SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, \n       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, \n       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, \n       AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, \n       AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, \n       AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, \n       COUNT(*) AS count_order \nFROM lineitem \nWHERE l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '90' DAY \nGROUP BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus \nORDER BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus;\n```\n\n**Optimized Query:**\nNo change needed here as the predicate is already pushed down.\n\n### 2. Use of Covering Index\n**Rule Applied:** If possible, use a covering index that includes the columns used in the `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` clauses, as well as the columns used in the aggregate functions. This can significantly speed up data retrieval and aggregation by reducing disk I/O and leveraging index-only scans.\n\n**Suggested Index:**\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX idx_lineitem_optimization ON lineitem(l_shipdate, l_returnflag, l_linestatus, l_quantity, l_extendedprice, l_discount, l_tax);\n```\n\n### 3. Simplify Expressions\n**Rule Applied:** Simplify arithmetic expressions in the `SELECT` clause to reduce computational overhead.\n\n**Optimized Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT l_returnflag, l_linestatus, \n       SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, \n       SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, \n       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, \n       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, \n       AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, \n       AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, \n       AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, \n       COUNT(*) AS count_order \nFROM lineitem \nWHERE l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '90' DAY \nGROUP BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus \nORDER BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus;\n```\nNo further simplification is possible without changing the meaning of the expressions.\n\n### 4. Early Aggregation\n**Rule Applied:** Perform aggregation as early as possible to reduce the volume of data being processed in later stages of the query.\n\n**Optimized Query:**\nAlready optimized in this regard, as aggregation is performed immediately after filtering and before ordering.\n\n### 5. Sorting and Grouping Optimization\n**Rule Applied:** Ensure that the `ORDER BY` clause aligns with the `GROUP BY` clause to utilize the sorting already done during grouping, avoiding additional sort operations.\n\n**Optimized Query:**\nAlready optimized as the `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` clauses are aligned.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe main optimization opportunities for this query lie in the use of a covering index and ensuring that the database engine can leverage index scans effectively. The query itself is well-structured with respect to the SQL operations order and does not require further optimization in terms of the SQL syntax or operation order.")

# Query 2
# print( "To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the amount of data processed and the complexity of the query execution. Here are the steps and the rules applied:\n\n### 1. **Push Selections Down**\n   **Rule Applied:** Push predicates as close as possible to the base tables.\n   - Move the conditions `p_size = 4` and `p_type LIKE %BRASS` directly after the `part` table is mentioned.\n   - Move the condition `r_name = 'ASIA'` directly after the `region` table is mentioned.\n\n### 2. **Predicate Pushdown in Subquery**\n   **Rule Applied:** Similar to the first rule, push relevant predicates into the subquery.\n   - In the subquery, ensure that the condition `r_name = 'ASIA'` is applied directly after the `region` table is mentioned.\n\n### 3. **Join Condition Simplification**\n   **Rule Applied:** Simplify and clearly specify join conditions.\n   - Explicitly use `JOIN` clauses to make the join conditions between tables clear and structured.\n\n### 4. **Use of EXISTS Instead of IN or Correlated Subquery**\n   **Rule Applied:** Convert the correlated subquery with `MIN` function into an `EXISTS` clause to potentially improve performance.\n   - This is particularly useful if the database engine handles `EXISTS` more efficiently than a correlated subquery.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n```sql\nSELECT s_acctbal, s_name, n_name, p_partkey, p_mfgr, s_address, s_phone, s_comment \nFROM part \nJOIN partsupp ON part.p_partkey = partsupp.ps_partkey\nJOIN supplier ON partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey\nJOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey\nJOIN region ON nation.n_regionkey = region.r_regionkey\nWHERE part.p_size = 4 \n  AND part.p_type LIKE '%BRASS'\n  AND region.r_name = 'ASIA'\n  AND partsupp.ps_supplycost = (\n    SELECT MIN(psupp.ps_supplycost)\n    FROM partsupp psupp\n    JOIN supplier supp ON psupp.ps_suppkey = supp.s_suppkey\n    JOIN nation nat ON supp.s_nationkey = nat.n_nationkey\n    JOIN region reg ON nat.n_regionkey = reg.r_regionkey\n    WHERE psupp.p_partkey = part.p_partkey\n      AND reg.r_name = 'ASIA'\n  )\nORDER BY s_acctbal DESC, n_name, s_name, p_partkey \nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Push Selections Down**: This reduces the number of rows early in the query processing, which decreases the amount of data that needs to be joined and processed in later stages.\n- **Predicate Pushdown in Subquery**: Ensures that the subquery is as efficient as possible by reducing the dataset it works on.\n- **Join Condition Simplification**: Using explicit `JOIN` conditions helps in understanding the query and can help the database optimizer in creating a more efficient execution plan.\n- **Use of EXISTS**: Although not applied here due to the specific requirement of matching the minimum supply cost, in other contexts, replacing subqueries with `EXISTS` can be beneficial.\n\nThese optimizations aim to make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and clarifying the operations to potentially aid the database's query optimizer.")

# Query 3
# print("To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the amount of data processed, the complexity of operations, and the number of times the same operations are computed. Here are the steps and rules applied:\n\n### 1. Pushing Selections Down\n**Rule Applied:** Push selections (filters) as close to the data source as possible.\n- This helps in reducing the size of intermediate results early in the query processing.\n- Apply the filter `n_name = 'JAPAN'` directly after the tables `nation` are accessed.\n\n### 2. Predicate Pushdown\n**Rule Applied:** Move predicates into the join condition.\n- This reduces the number of rows joined by eliminating non-matching rows early.\n- Include conditions like `ps_suppkey = s_suppkey` and `s_nationkey = n_nationkey` directly in the JOIN clauses.\n\n### 3. Common Sub-expression Elimination\n**Rule Applied:** Identify and compute common expressions once.\n- The expression `SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty)` is used multiple times in the query (in both the SELECT and HAVING clauses). Compute this once and reuse.\n\n### 4. Use of Derived Tables or Common Table Expressions (CTEs)\n**Rule Applied:** Factor out subqueries that are repeated or could benefit from being materialized.\n- The subquery calculating the threshold value `SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000` is a candidate for this, as it is used in the HAVING clause and does not depend on the outer query's GROUP BY.\n\n### 5. Limit Pushdown\n**Rule Applied:** Apply LIMIT as early as possible when it is guaranteed not to change the result.\n- Although not directly applicable here due to the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses, ensuring that the ORDER BY and LIMIT are the last operations can be beneficial.\n\n### Optimized Query\n```sql\nWITH FilteredData AS (\n    SELECT ps_partkey, ps_supplycost, ps_availqty\n    FROM partsupp\n    JOIN supplier ON ps_suppkey = s_suppkey\n    JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey\n    WHERE n_name = 'JAPAN'\n),\nAggregatedData AS (\n    SELECT ps_partkey, SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS total_value\n    FROM FilteredData\n    GROUP BY ps_partkey\n),\nThreshold AS (\n    SELECT SUM(total_value) * 0.0001000000 AS threshold_value\n    FROM AggregatedData\n)\nSELECT ps_partkey, total_value AS value\nFROM AggregatedData\nWHERE total_value > (SELECT threshold_value FROM Threshold)\nORDER BY value DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\n### Explanation of Optimization Steps:\n1. **FilteredData CTE:** Filters and joins are applied early to reduce the dataset size.\n2. **AggregatedData CTE:** Common sub-expression for sum calculation is done once.\n3. **Threshold CTE:** The threshold calculation is factored out to avoid repeated computation.\n4. **Final SELECT:** Uses results from CTEs, applying the HAVING condition transformed into a WHERE clause using the precomputed threshold, followed by ORDER BY and LIMIT.\n\nThis approach minimizes redundant calculations, reduces dataset sizes early, and ensures efficient use of joins and aggregations.")

Pushing Selections Down (Predicate Pushdown)\nThis rule moves filters (predicates) closer to the data source. It is beneficial to apply filters as early as possible, especially before joins or aggregations.\n\n**Application:**\nMove the date filter on `o_orderdate` down to reduce the number of rows processed in the main query and before checking the `EXISTS` condition.\n\nHowever, in this query, the filter is already optimally placed because it directly reduces the number of rows from the `orders` table before the `EXISTS` subquery is evaluated.\n\n#### 2. Rewriting EXISTS as JOIN\nThe `EXISTS` clause can often be rewritten as an inner join, which might be more efficient, especially if the DBMS has better optimization strategies for joins compared to subqueries.\n\n**Rewrite:**\nConvert the `EXISTS` subquery into an inner join. This can potentially allow better use of indexes and join algorithms.\n\n```sql\nSELECT o_orderpriority, COUNT(DISTINCT o_orderkey) AS order_count\nFROM orders\nJOIN lineitem ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey\nWHERE o_orderdate >= '1993-07-01' AND o_orderdate < '1993-10-01'\n  AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate\nGROUP BY o_orderpriority\nORDER BY o_orderpriority;\n```\n\nNote: We use `COUNT(DISTINCT o_orderkey)` to ensure that orders are not double-counted in case there are multiple `lineitem` records per order that meet the join condition.\n\n#### 3. Use of Indexes\nIf not already present, suggesting the use of indexes can significantly speed up the execution of the query. This is not a rewrite rule per se but a physical database optimization.\n\n**Recommended Indexes:**\n- An index on `orders(o_orderdate, o_orderkey, o_orderpriority)` to quickly filter and retrieve necessary order rows.\n- An index on `lineitem(l_orderkey, l_commitdate, l_receiptdate)` to speed up the join and the condition checks in the join.\n\n### Summary of Applied Rules\n1. **Predicate Pushdown:** Already optimally applied in the original query.\n2. **Rewriting EXISTS as JOIN:** Converted the `EXISTS` subquery to an inner join to potentially leverage better execution plans.\n3. **Suggesting Index Usage:** Recommended specific indexes to improve data retrieval speed.\n\nThese steps should help in optimizing the query execution by reducing the number of rows processed and improving the efficiency of data retrieval and join operations.")

# Query 5
# print("To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the amount of data processed and the complexity of the operations. Here are the steps and the rules applied:\n\n### 1. **Push Selections Down (Selection Pushdown)**\n   This rule moves filter conditions as close as possible to the base tables. This reduces the number of tuples in the intermediate results and minimizes the amount of data that needs to be joined.\n\n   - **Apply to `orders`**: Move the conditions `o_orderdate >= '1994-01-01'` and `o_orderdate < '1995-01-01'` directly after the table is mentioned.\n   - **Apply to `region`**: Move the condition `r_name = 'ASIA'` directly after the table is mentioned.\n\n### 2. **Push Joins Down (Join Pushdown)**\n   This rule rearranges joins to reduce the size of intermediate results by performing more selective joins earlier.\n\n   - **Join `nation` and `region` first**: Since the selection on `region` reduces the dataset significantly, join `nation` with `region` before joining with other tables.\n   - **Join `customer` and `orders` next**: Since `orders` has already been filtered by date, joining it with `customer` next is efficient.\n   - **Join `supplier` with the result of `nation` and `region`**: This ensures that only suppliers from the correct nations (and thus regions) are considered.\n\n### 3. **Use of Indexes**\n   If not already present, consider adding indexes on the join and filter columns (`c_custkey`, `o_custkey`, `l_orderkey`, `o_orderkey`, `l_suppkey`, `s_suppkey`, `c_nationkey`, `s_nationkey`, `s_nationkey`, `n_nationkey`, `n_regionkey`, `r_regionkey`, `r_name`, `o_orderdate`). This accelerates the selection and join operations.\n\n### 4. **Column Pruning**\n   Ensure that only the necessary columns are fetched from each table, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and transferred among operations.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n```sql\nSELECT n_name, SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue\nFROM \n    (SELECT n_nationkey, n_name FROM nation\n     JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey AND r_name = 'ASIA') AS nr\nJOIN \n    customer ON c_nationkey = nr.n_nationkey\nJOIN \n    orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey AND o_orderdate >= '1994-01-01' AND o_orderdate < '1995-01-01'\nJOIN \n    lineitem ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey\nJOIN \n    supplier ON s_suppkey = l_suppkey AND s_nationkey = nr.n_nationkey\nGROUP BY n_name\nORDER BY revenue DESC;\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rules Applied:\n1. **Selection Pushdown**: Filters are applied directly in the subqueries or immediately after mentioning the table.\n2. **Join Pushdown**: More selective joins are performed earlier.\n3. **Use of Indexes**: Assumed or recommended to speed up filtering and joining.\n4. **Column Pruning**: Only necessary columns are included in the subqueries and joins.\n\nThese optimizations should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data loaded and processed, and by utilizing indexes to speed up joins and filters.")

# print( "To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the amount of data processed and improve the execution plan.

This reduces the number of rows processed early in the execution plan, which can significantly decrease the amount of data that needs to be handled in later stages.\n\n2. **Conjunction Ordering**: Adjust the order of the predicates to evaluate the most selective conditions first. This can reduce the number of rows quickly if certain conditions filter out a large portion of the data early.\n\n3. **Use of Indexes**: If indexes exist on the columns used in the WHERE clause, the database can quickly locate the rows that satisfy the conditions without scanning the entire table. This is not a rewrite rule per se, but a physical optimization consideration that can be influenced by how predicates are structured.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n\nAssuming that the data distribution is such that `l_shipdate`, `l_discount`, and `l_quantity` filters are highly selective, and assuming appropriate indexes are available, the query can be rewritten as:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue\nFROM lineitem\nWHERE l_shipdate >= '1994-01-01' \n  AND l_shipdate < '1995-01-01'\n  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.05 AND 0.07\n  AND l_quantity < 24;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Predicate Pushdown**: All conditions are kept in the WHERE clause, ensuring they are evaluated as early as possible, ideally at the data retrieval stage.\n\n- **Conjunction Ordering**: Assuming no specific data distribution knowledge or index details, the original order of predicates is maintained. However, if, for example, `l_quantity < 24` is known to be highly selective and there's an index on `l_quantity`, it might be beneficial to evaluate this condition first.\n\n- **Use of Indexes**: If there are indexes on `l_shipdate`, `l_discount`, and `l_quantity`, the database engine can efficiently filter rows based on these conditions. If not, consider adding indexes, especially if these columns are frequently used in queries with similar filters.\n\n### Final Note:\n\nWithout specific details on data distribution and available indexes, the optimization primarily focuses on logical restructuring. For physical optimization, such as leveraging indexes, further information about the database schema and index configuration would be necessary. Additionally, the database's query optimizer often automatically applies many of these rules, so the actual execution plan should be reviewed (using EXPLAIN or similar tools) to verify the impact of any manual changes.")

This reduces the size of intermediate results.\n\n   **Optimization:**\n   Start joins with `nation` tables filtered by `n_name` ('FRANCE' or 'GERMANY'), then join `supplier` and `customer` based on the nation keys, and finally join `orders` and `lineitem`.\n\n### 3. **Use of Semi-Joins**\n   When the query involves foreign key-primary key equality conditions (like `s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey`), a semi-join can be more efficient than a regular join because it reduces duplication early.\n\n   **Optimization:**\n   Convert applicable joins to semi-joins where possible, especially in many-to-one relationships from `supplier` to `nation` and `customer` to `nation`.\n\n### 4. **Column Pruning**\n   Remove unnecessary columns from the SELECT list of subqueries if they are not used in the final output or in any computations.\n\n   **Optimization:**\n   Ensure that only the necessary columns (`n_name`, `l_shipdate`, `l_extendedprice`, `l_discount`) are selected in the subquery.\n\n### 5. **Aggregation Pushdown**\n   If possible, push down aggregation closer to the data source.

Selection Pushdown (Filter on `part` table).\n2. Join Order Optimization (Rearranging joins).\n3. Projection Pushdown (Selecting only necessary columns early).\n4. Group By and Order By Optimization (Aligning data processing with grouping and ordering needs).\n\nThis optimized query should perform better by reducing the amount of data processed at each step and by leveraging efficient join and filter strategies.")

# print( "To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the amount of data processed and the complexity of the operations. Here are the steps and the rules applied:\n\n### 1. **Push Selections Down (Predicate Pushdown)**\n   **Rule Applied:** Move the selection conditions as close as possible to the data sources.\n   - Move the conditions `o_orderdate >= '1993-10-01'` and `o_orderdate < '1994-01-01'` to the `orders` table.\n   - Move the condition `l_returnflag = 'R'` to the `lineitem` table.\n\n   **Modified Query:**\n   ```sql\n   select c_custkey, c_name, sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue, c_acctbal, n_name, c_address, c_phone, c_comment \n   from customer, (select * from orders where o_orderdate >= '1993-10-01' and o_orderdate < '1994-01-01') as orders, \n        (select * from lineitem where l_returnflag = 'R') as lineitem, nation \n   where c_custkey = o_custkey and l_orderkey = o_orderkey and c_nationkey = n_nationkey \n   group by c_custkey, c_name, c_acctbal, c_phone, n_name, c_address, c_comment \n   order by revenue desc, c_custkey \n   limit 20\n   ```\n\n### 2. **Join Order Optimization**\n   **Rule Applied:** Reorder joins to reduce the size of intermediate results.\n   - Join smaller tables or more restrictive tables earlier if possible. Here, since `orders` and `lineitem` are filtered by date and return flag, they might be smaller, so join them first.\n\n   **Modified Query:**\n   ```sql\n   select c_custkey, c_name, sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue, c_acctbal, n_name, c_address, c_phone, c_comment \n   from (select * from orders where o_orderdate >= '1993-10-01' and o_orderdate < '1994-01-01') as orders\n   join (select * from lineitem where l_returnflag = 'R') as lineitem on l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n   join customer on c_custkey = o_custkey\n   join nation on c_nationkey = n_nationkey \n   group by c_custkey, c_name, c_acctbal, c_phone, n_name, c_address, c_comment \n   order by revenue desc, c_custkey \n   limit 20\n   ```\n\n### 3. **Use of Indexes**\n   **Rule Applied:** Ensure that indexes are available on the join and filter columns to speed up access.\n   - Ideally, indexes should exist on `o_orderdate`, `l_returnflag`, `c_custkey`, `o_custkey`, `l_orderkey`, `o_orderkey`, and `c_nationkey`.\n\n### 4. **Limit Pushdown**\n   **Rule Applied:** Push the limit operation down to reduce the number of rows processed in the grouping and sorting operations.\n   - This is more of a logical optimization that depends on the SQL engine's capability to integrate limit with sorting and grouping efficiently.\n\n### Summary of Applied Rules:\n1. **Predicate Pushdown:** Filters are pushed closer to the table scans.\n2. **Join Order Optimization:** Reordering joins to process fewer rows earlier.\n3. **Use of Indexes:** Suggested to ensure indexes are used.\n4. **Limit Pushdown:** Logical optimization depending on the SQL engine.\n\nThese optimizations should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and by utilizing indexes effectively.")

Here are the steps and rules applied:\n\n### 1. Push Selections Down\n**Rule Applied:** Push selection predicates (filters) closer to the data source.\n- **Reason:** This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query. By applying the filter `n_name = 'GERMANY'` as early as possible, we reduce the number of rows from `supplier` and `partsupp` that need to be joined and aggregated.\n\n### 2. Common Sub-expression Elimination\n**Rule Applied:** Identify and compute common sub-expressions once.\n- **Reason:** The subquery calculating `sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001` for `n_name = 'GERMANY'` is used as a threshold in the outer query's WHERE clause. This value can be computed once and reused, rather than being recalculated for each row in the outer query.\n\n### 3. Join Elimination\n**Rule Applied:** Eliminate unnecessary joins.\n- **Reason:** If certain joins do not affect the result of the aggregation or filters, they can be removed. However, in this case, all joins seem necessary to correctly filter and compute the required sums based on the supplier's nation.\n\n### 4.

Here are the steps and the rules applied:\n\n### 1. Push Selections Down\n**Rule Applied:** Push predicates into the FROM clause (selection pushdown).\n- This rule moves conditions into the JOIN clause or WHERE clause as early as possible to reduce the number of rows processed in the subsequent steps of the query.\n\n**Optimization:**\n```sql\nSELECT l_shipmode,\n       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' OR o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_line_count,\n       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' AND o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS low_line_count\nFROM orders\nJOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey\nWHERE l_shipmode IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')\n  AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate\n  AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate\n  AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1994-01-01'\n  AND l_receiptdate < DATE '1995-01-01'\nGROUP BY l_shipmode\nORDER BY l_shipmode;\n```\n- Conditions on `l_shipmode`, `l_commitdate`, `l_shipdate`, and `l_receiptdate` are pushed down to reduce the number of rows joined and processed.\n\n### 2. Use Proper Data Types and Formats\n**Rule Applied:** Ensure correct data types and formats in predicates.\n- This rule ensures that literals in predicates are correctly formatted, especially dates and strings, to avoid implicit type conversion during query execution.\n\n**Optimization:**\n- Ensure that date literals are explicitly cast or written in the standard format (e.g., `DATE '1994-01-01'`) and string comparisons are enclosed in single quotes.\n\n### 3. Simplify Expressions\n**Rule Applied:** Simplify CASE expressions.\n- Simplifying logical expressions in CASE statements can sometimes help in reducing the complexity and improving readability, although in this case, the expressions are already quite optimized.\n\n### 4. Index Usage (Suggestive)\n**Rule Applied:** Suggest the use of appropriate indexes.\n- Although not directly a rewrite rule, suggesting the use of indexes on columns involved in joins and where clauses can significantly improve performance.\n\n**Suggested Indexes:**\n- An index on `lineitem(l_orderkey, l_shipmode, l_commitdate, l_receiptdate, l_shipdate)` could be beneficial.\n- An index on `orders(o_orderkey, o_orderpriority)` could also help.\n\n### Final Optimized Query\n```sql\nSELECT l_shipmode,\n       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' OR o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_line_count,\n       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' AND o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS low_line_count\nFROM orders\nJOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey\nWHERE l_shipmode IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')\n  AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate\n  AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate\n  AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1994-01-01'\n  AND l_receiptdate < DATE '1995-01-01'\nGROUP BY l_shipmode\nORDER BY l_shipmode;\n```\n\nThis query is optimized based on the rules applied, focusing on reducing the data scanned and processed by pushing down selections and ensuring proper data types and formats are used.")

This is valid because the `LEFT JOIN` conditionally combines rows and the predicate filters rows from `orders`. The `OR o_comment IS NULL` ensures that customers without orders are included, preserving the left join semantics.\n\n### Step 2: Use of Efficient Aggregation\n**Rule Applied:** Use efficient aggregation functions or methods if possible.\n\n**Reason:** Since we are counting `o_orderkey`, which can be NULL due to the LEFT JOIN, we can use `COUNT(o_orderkey)` directly in the subquery without additional checks.\n\n### Final Optimized Query:\n```sql\nSELECT c_count, COUNT(*) AS custdist\nFROM (\n    SELECT c_custkey, COUNT(o_orderkey) AS c_count\n    FROM customer\n    LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey\n    WHERE o_comment NOT LIKE '%special%requests%' OR o_comment IS NULL\n    GROUP BY c_custkey\n) AS c_orders\nGROUP BY c_count\nORDER BY custdist DESC, c_count DESC;\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Indexing:** Ensure that there are indexes on `c_custkey` in the `customer` table and `o_custkey`, `o_comment` in the `orders` table to speed up the join and the filtering process.\n- **Materialized View:** If this query is run frequently with similar filtering, consider using a materialized view to store the intermediate results.\n\nBy applying these rules, the query is optimized to reduce the amount of data scanned and processed, and to utilize indexes effectively.")

# print("To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without changing the result.

Here's the original query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT 100.00 * SUM(CASE WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) ELSE 0.0 END) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS promo_revenue\nFROM lineitem, part\nWHERE l_partkey = p_partkey\n  AND l_shipdate >= '1995-09-01'\n  AND l_shipdate < '1995-10-01';\n```\n\n### Optimization Steps\n\n#### 1. Predicate Pushdown\nThis rule moves predicates (filters) as close as possible to the data source. Applying this rule allows the database to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution plan, which can significantly reduce the cost of later operations like joins.\n\n**Application:**\nPush the date filter on `l_shipdate` directly into the table scan of `lineitem`.\n\n```sql\nFROM lineitem, part\nWHERE l_partkey = p_partkey\n  AND l_shipdate >= '1995-09-01'\n  AND l_shipdate < '1995-10-01';\n```\n\n#### 2. Join Condition Reordering\nThis isn't strictly applicable here as there's only one join condition, but ensuring that the most selective join conditions (or those that reduce the result set the most) are evaluated first can be beneficial.\n\n#### 3. Use of Inner Join Syntax\nChanging the implicit join (comma-separated) to an explicit INNER JOIN can improve readability and potentially allow the optimizer to better understand the join conditions.\n\n**Application:**\nConvert the implicit join to an explicit INNER JOIN.\n\n```sql\nFROM lineitem\nINNER JOIN part ON l_partkey = p_partkey\nWHERE l_shipdate >= '1995-09-01'\n  AND l_shipdate < '1995-10-01';\n```\n\n#### 4. Column Pruning\nEnsure that only the necessary columns are being fetched from the database. In this query, we are using `l_extendedprice`, `l_discount`, `p_type`, and the keys for join conditions. Make sure no additional columns are fetched if not listed explicitly.\n\n#### 5. Magic Value Optimization\nIn the SELECT clause, the CASE statement uses a LIKE operator which can be expensive. If the number of `p_type` values starting with 'PROMO' is limited and known, replacing `LIKE 'PROMO%'` with an equality check against those specific values might be faster, though this depends on the data distribution and index availability.\n\n### Optimized Query\n```sql\nSELECT 100.00 * SUM(CASE WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) ELSE 0.0 END) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS promo_revenue\nFROM lineitem\nINNER JOIN part ON l_partkey = p_partkey\nWHERE l_shipdate >= '1995-09-01'\n  AND l_shipdate < '1995-10-01';\n```\n\n### Summary of Applied Rules\n1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to move date filters closer to the data scan of `lineitem`.\n2. **Use of Inner Join Syntax**: Improved readability and potentially optimization paths by using explicit join syntax.\n3. **Column Pruning**: Ensured only necessary columns are used (implicitly applied here as the query specifies columns in calculations).\n\nThese optimizations should help in reducing the amount of data processed and improve the overall execution time of the query.")

Predicate Pushdown\n**Rule Applied:** Move the predicates as close as possible to the data source in the query.\n\n**Reason:** This reduces the amount of data processed in the early stages of the query, which can significantly improve performance.\n\n**Application:**\nIn the subquery `revenue_view`, the predicates on `l_shipdate` are already pushed down. This is optimal as it filters rows before any other operations like grouping or aggregation.\n\n### 2. Join Elimination\n**Rule Applied:** Eliminate unnecessary joins if the join attribute uniquely identifies rows in the joined table or if the joined table attributes are not used.\n\n**Reason:** Reducing the number of joins can decrease the complexity and cost of the query.\n\n**Application:**\nIn this case, the join between `supplier` and `revenue_view` is necessary because we need columns from both tables (`s_suppkey`, `s_name`, `s_address`, `s_phone` from `supplier` and `total_revenue` from `revenue_view`). Thus, join elimination is not applicable here.\n\n### 3. Subquery to Join Transformation\n**Rule Applied:** Convert subqueries to joins where applicable to enable better optimization by the query planner.\n\n**Reason:** Some SQL engines optimize joins better than correlated subqueries.\n\n**Application:**\nThe subquery that selects the maximum `total_revenue` from `revenue_view` can be transformed into a join:\n\n```sql\nwith revenue_view as (\n    select l_suppkey as supplier_no, sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as total_revenue\n    from lineitem\n    where l_shipdate >= '1996-01-01' and l_shipdate < '1996-04-01'\n    group by l_suppkey\n), max_revenue as (\n    select max(total_revenue) as max_total_revenue\n    from revenue_view\n)\nselect s.s_suppkey, s.s_name, s.s_address, s.s_phone, rv.total_revenue\nfrom supplier s\njoin revenue_view rv on s.s_suppkey = rv.supplier_no\njoin max_revenue mr on rv.total_revenue = mr.max_total_revenue\norder by s.s_suppkey;\n```\n\n### 4. Use of Proper Date Formatting\n**Rule Applied:** Ensure proper use of literals and data types.\n\n**Reason:** Incorrect data types or formats can lead to full table scans or incorrect results.\n\n**Application:**\nEnsure that date literals are properly quoted to prevent them from being interpreted as arithmetic expressions:\n\n```sql\nl_shipdate >= '1996-01-01' and l_shipdate < '1996-04-01'\n```\n\n### Summary of Optimization Steps:\n1. **Predicate Pushdown:** Already optimally applied in the query.\n2. **Join Elimination:** Not applicable as all joins are necessary.\n3. **Subquery to Join Transformation:** Transformed the subquery for maximum revenue into a join for potentially better performance.\n4. **Proper Date Formatting:** Ensured date literals are correctly formatted to prevent errors and ensure correct execution.\n\nThese steps help in making the query more efficient by leveraging SQL engine optimizations and reducing the amount of data processed and transferred across different stages of the query execution.")

By applying this rule, we can filter rows earlier in the query process, which reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages.\n\n**Application:**\n- Move the filters on `part` (`p_brand`, `p_type`, `p_size`) directly into the selection from the `part` table.\n- Move the subquery filter on `ps_suppkey` directly into the selection from the `partsupp` table.\n\n**Rewritten Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT p_brand, p_type, p_size, COUNT(DISTINCT ps_suppkey) AS supplier_cnt\nFROM (\n    SELECT ps_partkey, ps_suppkey\n    FROM partsupp\n    WHERE ps_suppkey NOT IN (\n        SELECT s_suppkey\n        FROM supplier\n        WHERE s_comment LIKE '%%Customer%%Complaints%%'\n    )\n) ps\nJOIN (\n    SELECT p_partkey, p_brand, p_type, p_size\n    FROM part\n    WHERE p_brand <> 'Brand#45'\n      AND p_type NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%%'\n      AND p_size IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)\n) p ON p.p_partkey = ps.ps_partkey\nGROUP BY p_brand, p_type, p_size\nORDER BY supplier_cnt DESC, p_brand, p_type, p_size;\n```\n\n### 2. **Join Elimination**\nIf a join or subquery does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated. However, in this case, both joins are necessary for the final result, so this rule does not apply.\n\n### 3. **Subquery Flattening**\nThis rule simplifies subqueries into joins where possible, which can make the query easier for the optimizer to handle and potentially more efficient.\n\n**Application:**\n- The subquery used in the `NOT IN` clause is already optimized by being directly connected to the `partsupp` table in the predicate pushdown step.\n\n### 4. **Use of Indexes**\nWhile not a rewrite rule per se, suggesting the use of indexes can significantly improve query performance. This is more of a physical optimization suggestion.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Ensure there are indexes on `part(p_partkey, p_brand, p_type, p_size)` and `partsupp(ps_partkey, ps_suppkey)`.\n- An index on `supplier(s_suppkey, s_comment)` would help the subquery perform better.\n\n### Summary of Applied Rules:\n1. **Predicate Pushdown** was applied to move filters closer to the data sources, reducing the amount of data processed in later stages of the query.\n2. **Subquery Flattening** was considered but found unnecessary due to the structure of the query after predicate pushdown.\n\nThese optimizations should make the query more efficient by reducing the number of rows processed and ensuring that operations are performed on the smallest possible datasets at each step.")

By applying this rule, we can reduce the number of rows processed in the early stages of the query, which reduces the overall cost of the query.\n\n**Application:**\n- Push the conditions `p_brand = 'Brand#23'` and `p_container = 'MED BOX'` directly into the subquery that joins `lineitem` and `part`. This reduces the size of the join by filtering out unnecessary rows from `part` early.\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly\nFROM lineitem\nJOIN part ON p_partkey = l_partkey\nWHERE p_brand = 'Brand#23'\n  AND p_container = 'MED BOX'\n  AND l_quantity < (\n    SELECT 0.2 * AVG(l_quantity)\n    FROM lineitem\n    WHERE l_partkey = p_partkey\n  )\n```\n\n#### 2. **Subquery Simplification**\nThis rule simplifies subqueries where possible. In this case, the subquery calculates `0.2 * AVG(l_quantity)` for each `p_partkey`. We can simplify this by precomputing the average quantities multiplied by 0.2 for each `p_partkey` in a derived table or with a common table expression (CTE), which avoids recalculating the average for each row.\n\n**Application:**\n- Use a CTE to precompute the `0.2 * AVG(l_quantity)` for each `p_partkey`.\n\n```sql\nWITH AvgQuantities AS (\n  SELECT l_partkey, 0.2 * AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_quant\n  FROM lineitem\n  GROUP BY l_partkey\n)\nSELECT SUM(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly\nFROM lineitem\nJOIN part ON p_partkey = l_partkey\nJOIN AvgQuantities ON AvgQuantities.l_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey\nWHERE p_brand = 'Brand#23'\n  AND p_container = 'MED BOX'\n  AND l_quantity < AvgQuantities.avg_quant\n```\n\n#### 3. **Join Elimination**\nIf after applying the previous rules, there are any unnecessary joins, they should be eliminated.

Here are the steps and the rules applied:\n\n### Original Query\n```sql\nSELECT c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, SUM(l_quantity)\nFROM customer, orders, lineitem\nWHERE o_orderkey IN (\n    SELECT l_orderkey\n    FROM lineitem\n    GROUP BY l_orderkey\n    HAVING SUM(l_quantity) > 300\n)\nAND c_custkey = o_custkey\nAND o_orderkey = l_orderkey\nGROUP BY c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice\nORDER BY o_totalprice DESC, o_orderdate, o_orderkey\nLIMIT 100\n```\n\n### Step 1: Use Join Instead of Subquery\n**Rule Applied**: Transform IN to JOIN.\n- Convert the subquery using `IN` to an explicit `JOIN`, which can be more efficient as it allows better use of indexes and join optimizations.\n\n```sql\nSELECT c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, SUM(l_quantity)\nFROM customer\nJOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey\nJOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey\nJOIN (\n    SELECT l_orderkey\n    FROM lineitem\n    GROUP BY l_orderkey\n    HAVING SUM(l_quantity) > 300\n) AS filtered_lineitems ON lineitem.l_orderkey = filtered_lineitems.l_orderkey\nGROUP BY c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice\nORDER BY o_totalprice DESC, o_orderdate, o_orderkey\nLIMIT 100\n```\n\n### Step 2: Push Predicates\n**Rule Applied**: Push predicates into the subquery.\n- Move the condition on `l_quantity` directly into the join condition to reduce the size of the joined table.\n\n```sql\nSELECT c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, SUM(l_quantity)\nFROM customer\nJOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey\nJOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey\nJOIN (\n    SELECT l_orderkey\n    FROM lineitem\n    GROUP BY l_orderkey\n    HAVING SUM(l_quantity) > 300\n) AS filtered_lineitems ON lineitem.l_orderkey = filtered_lineitems.l_orderkey\nGROUP BY c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice\nORDER BY o_totalprice DESC, o_orderdate, o_orderkey\nLIMIT 100\n```\n\n### Step 3: Eliminate Redundant Group By\n**Rule Applied**: Eliminate redundant GROUP BY operations.\n- Since we are already grouping by `l_orderkey` in the subquery and filtering based on `SUM(l_quantity)`, we can avoid re-aggregating `l_quantity` in the outer query.\n\n```sql\nSELECT c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, SUM(l_quantity) AS total_quantity\nFROM customer\nJOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey\nJOIN (\n    SELECT l_orderkey, SUM(l_quantity) AS l_quantity\n    FROM lineitem\n    GROUP BY l_orderkey\n    HAVING SUM(l_quantity) > 300\n) AS filtered_lineitems ON orders.o_orderkey = filtered_lineitems.l_orderkey\nGROUP BY c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice\nORDER BY o_totalprice DESC, o_orderdate, o_orderkey\nLIMIT 100\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThe optimized query uses explicit joins instead of subqueries, pushes predicates into subqueries, and eliminates redundant grouping operations. This should lead to better performance by reducing the amount of data processed and leveraging indexes more effectively.")

# print("To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the amount of data processed and improve the execution plan. Here are the steps and rules applied:\n\n### 1. **Predicate Pushdown**\nThis rule moves predicates as close as possible to the data source. By applying this rule, we can filter rows earlier in the query process, which reduces the number of rows that need to be joined and aggregated later.\n\n**Original Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue\nFROM lineitem, part\nWHERE p_partkey = l_partkey\n  AND (\n    (p_brand = 'Brand#12' AND p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')\n     AND l_quantity >= 1 AND l_quantity <= 11 AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5\n     AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')\n  OR\n    (p_brand = 'Brand#23' AND p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')\n     AND l_quantity >= 10 AND l_quantity <= 20 AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10\n     AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')\n  OR\n    (p_brand = 'Brand#34' AND p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')\n     AND l_quantity >= 20 AND l_quantity <= 30 AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15\n     AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')\n  )\n```\n\n**After Predicate Pushdown:**\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue\nFROM (\n  SELECT l_extendedprice, l_discount\n  FROM lineitem\n  WHERE (l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')\n    AND (\n      (l_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 11)\n   OR (l_quantity BETWEEN 10 AND 20)\n   OR (l_quantity BETWEEN 20 AND 30)\n    )\n) AS filtered_lineitem\nJOIN (\n  SELECT p_partkey\n  FROM part\n  WHERE (\n    (p_brand = 'Brand#12' AND p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5)\n OR (p_brand = 'Brand#23' AND p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10)\n OR (p_brand = 'Brand#34' AND p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15)\n  )\n) AS filtered_part\nON filtered_lineitem.l_partkey = filtered_part.p_partkey\n```\n\n### 2. **Join Elimination**\nIf after applying predicate pushdown, certain attributes are not needed for the final result, we can eliminate unnecessary joins. However, in this case, the join is necessary to match `l_partkey` with `p_partkey`.\n\n### 3. **Projection Pushdown**\nThis rule involves pushing the projection of columns as close as possible to the data source. Since we only need `l_extendedprice`, `l_discount`, and `l_partkey` from `lineitem` and `p_partkey` from `part`, we ensure only these columns are fetched.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe main optimization applied here is Predicate Pushdown, which significantly reduces the amount of data being processed by filtering early in both the `lineitem` and `part` tables. Projection Pushdown ensures that only necessary columns are processed. These optimizations should lead to a more efficient execution plan by reducing I/O and computational overhead.")

# print("To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules help in simplifying the query, reducing the amount of data processed, and improving the overall execution plan. Here are the steps and rules applied:\n\n### 1. Predicate Pushdown\nThis rule moves predicates (conditions) closer to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in the upper levels of the query.\n\n**Application:**\n- Push the condition `n_name = 'CANADA'` directly into the join condition between `supplier` and `nation`. This reduces the number of rows from `nation` early in the query processing.\n- Push the condition `p_name LIKE 'forest%'` into the subquery that selects from `part`. This filters rows earlier when accessing the `part` table.\n\n### 2. Subquery Flattening\nFlattening subqueries can transform them into joins, which might be more efficient, especially if the database can better optimize joins than correlated subqueries.\n\n**Application:**\n- Flatten the subquery that selects from `partsupp` where `ps_partkey` is in the subquery selecting from `part`. This can be converted into a join, reducing the need for nested loops or repeated subquery execution.\n\n### 3. Join Reordering\nReordering joins can help in executing less costly joins earlier, which reduces the size of intermediate results.\n\n**Application:**\n- Reorder joins to ensure that smaller tables or more restrictive conditions are processed earlier. For example, joining `supplier` with `nation` filtered by `n_name = 'CANADA'` before joining with the result from `partsupp`.\n\n### 4. Aggregate Pushdown\nPushing down aggregation operations can reduce the volume of data transferred between subqueries and main queries.\n\n**Application:**\n- Push the aggregation `0.5 * sum(l_quantity)` closer to the source of `lineitem` data, ensuring that the aggregation is computed before joining with `partsupp`.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n```sql\nSELECT s_name, s_address \nFROM supplier\nJOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey\nJOIN partsupp ON supplier.s_suppkey = partsupp.ps_suppkey\nJOIN part ON partsupp.ps_partkey = part.p_partkey\nLEFT JOIN (\n    SELECT l_partkey, l_suppkey, 0.5 * SUM(l_quantity) AS half_sum_qty\n    FROM lineitem\n    WHERE l_shipdate >= '1994-01-01' AND l_shipdate < '1995-01-01'\n    GROUP BY l_partkey, l_suppkey\n) AS li ON partsupp.ps_partkey = li.l_partkey AND partsupp.ps_suppkey = li.l_suppkey\nWHERE nation.n_name = 'CANADA'\nAND part.p_name LIKE 'forest%'\nAND partsupp.ps_availqty > COALESCE(li.half_sum_qty, 0)\nORDER BY s_name;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Predicate Pushdown:** Applied to move conditions on `n_name` and `p_name` closer to their respective tables.\n- **Subquery Flattening:** The subquery for `partsupp` is flattened into a join.\n- **Join Reordering:** The joins are reordered to process restrictive conditions earlier.\n- **Aggregate Pushdown:** The aggregation in the subquery for `lineitem` is computed in a derived table to minimize the data processed in the main query.\n\nThese optimizations should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and taking advantage of more efficient join and aggregation strategies.")

# print("To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules help in reducing the amount of data processed, simplifying joins, and improving the overall efficiency of the query execution. Here are the steps and rules applied:\n\n### 1. **Predicate Pushdown**\nThis rule moves predicates (filters) closer to the data source. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the size of intermediate results and minimize the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages of the query.\n\n- Move `o_orderstatus = 'F'` to the join condition between `orders` and `lineitem l1`.\n- Move `n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA'` to the join condition between `supplier` and `nation`.\n\n### 2. **Join Elimination**\nIf a table in a join operation does not contribute to the final result other than through a foreign key check, and if the foreign key relationship is guaranteed by database constraints, that table can be removed from the join.\n\n- Since `nation` is only used to filter `s_nationkey` based on `n_name`, and assuming `s_nationkey` is a foreign key with referential integrity, we can eliminate the join with `nation` if we push the filter on `n_name` directly into the selection of `supplier`.\n\n### 3. **Semi Join Reduction**\nConvert `EXISTS` to a `JOIN` when it is used to check the existence of a matching row, which can be more efficient than a correlated subquery.\n\n- Convert the first `EXISTS` subquery into a join with `lineitem l2` and ensure `l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey`.\n\n### 4. **Anti Join Reduction**\nConvert `NOT EXISTS` to an `ANTI JOIN`. This is similar to a semi join but ensures rows do not exist in the joined table.\n\n- Convert the second `NOT EXISTS` subquery into an anti join with `lineitem l3` ensuring `l3.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey` and `l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate`.\n\n### 5. **Column Pruning**\nRemove unnecessary columns from the SELECT and JOIN clauses that are not needed for the final output or in subsequent operations.\n\n- Ensure only necessary columns are selected from each table, especially in subqueries and joins.\n\n### Optimized Query\n```sql\nSELECT s_name, COUNT(*) AS numwait\nFROM supplier\nJOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey AND nation.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA'\nJOIN lineitem l1 ON supplier.s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey\nJOIN orders ON l1.l_orderkey = orders.o_orderkey AND orders.o_orderstatus = 'F'\nLEFT JOIN lineitem l2 ON l1.l_orderkey = l2.l_orderkey AND l1.l_suppkey <> l2.l_suppkey\nLEFT ANTI JOIN lineitem l3 ON l1.l_orderkey = l3.l_orderkey AND l1.l_suppkey <> l3.l_suppkey AND l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate\nWHERE l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate\nGROUP BY s_name\nORDER BY numwait DESC, s_name\nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\n### Explanation of Applied Rules:\n1. **Predicate Pushdown** was used to move filters closer to the data source.\n2. **Join Elimination** was considered but not applied due to the lack of explicit foreign key constraints.\n3. **Semi Join Reduction** and **Anti Join Reduction** were used to transform `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` into more efficient join operations.\n4. **Column Pruning** ensures minimal data processing.\n\nThese optimizations should lead to a more efficient execution of the query by reducing the amount of data shuffled and processed, leveraging joins more effectively, and minimizing the overhead of subqueries.")

This calculation is done only once and reused in the main query, which avoids recalculating the average for each row in the main query.\n\n2. **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `c_acctbal` and `c_phone` are applied directly in the subquery `filtered_customers`, reducing the number of rows processed in the outer query.\n\n3. **Materialization of Subquery Results**: By using CTEs (`avg_acctbal` and `filtered_customers`), the results of these subqueries are materialized. This prevents repeated execution of these calculations and filters during the main query execution.\n\nThese optimizations should lead to a more efficient execution plan by reducing the amount of data processed and avoiding redundant calculations.")
