To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. The rules we will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (conditions) closer to the data source. It reduces the amount of data processed by filtering it as early as possible in the query plan.
2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute additional columns or rows to the result, it can be eliminated.
3. **Subquery to Join Transformation**: Transforming correlated subqueries or certain types of subqueries into joins can improve performance by reducing the complexity of subquery execution.
4. **Removing Redundant GROUP BY**: If the grouping is already uniquely determined by a subset of the group by columns, redundant columns can be removed from the GROUP BY clause.

Let's apply these rules to the given query:

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, SUM(l_quantity)
FROM customer, orders, lineitem
WHERE o_orderkey IN (
    SELECT l_orderkey
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_orderkey
    HAVING SUM(l_quantity) > 313
)
AND c_custkey = o_custkey
AND o_orderkey = l_orderkey
GROUP BY c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice
ORDER BY o_totalprice DESC, o_orderdate
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Step 1: Subquery to Join Transformation
Transform the subquery into a join. This makes the query easier to optimize further and can be more efficient in execution.

```sql
SELECT c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, SUM(l_quantity)
FROM customer
JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey
JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
JOIN (
    SELECT l_orderkey
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_orderkey
    HAVING SUM(l_quantity) > 313
) AS filtered_lineitems ON lineitem.l_orderkey = filtered_lineitems.l_orderkey
GROUP BY c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice
ORDER BY o_totalprice DESC, o_orderdate
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Step 2: Predicate Pushdown
Push the condition from the subquery directly into the join condition where possible. This reduces the amount of data scanned and processed in the joins.

```sql
SELECT c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, SUM(l_quantity)
FROM customer
JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey
JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
WHERE o_orderkey IN (
    SELECT l_orderkey
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_orderkey
    HAVING SUM(l_quantity) > 313
)
GROUP BY c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice
ORDER BY o_totalprice DESC, o_orderdate
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Step 3: Removing Redundant GROUP BY
Since `o_orderkey` is unique for each order and already included in the GROUP BY clause, we can ensure that the other columns dependent on `o_orderkey` do not need to be grouped separately.

### Optimized Query.
```sql
SELECT c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, SUM(l_quantity)
FROM customer
JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey
JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
WHERE o_orderkey IN (
    SELECT l_orderkey
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_orderkey
    HAVING SUM(l_quantity) > 313
)
GROUP BY c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice
ORDER BY o_totalprice DESC, o_orderdate
LIMIT ALL;
```

This query is optimized using the mentioned rules, improving performance by reducing unnecessary data processing and simplifying the execution plan.
