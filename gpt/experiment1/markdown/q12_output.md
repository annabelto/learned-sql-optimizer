To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering its semantics. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Pushing Selections Down**: This rule involves moving filter conditions as close as possible to the data retrieval operations. This reduces the number of rows processed in the subsequent steps of the query.

2. **Using Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This improves readability and aligns with SQL best practices. It also makes it clearer how tables are related and what the join conditions are.

3. **Eliminating Redundant Operations**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause at the end of the query is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it simplifies the query.

Here's the optimized query with explanations for each step:

```sql
SELECT 
    l_shipmode, 
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' OR o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS high_line_count, 
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' AND o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS low_line_count 
FROM 
    orders 
JOIN 
    lineitem 
ON 
    o_orderkey = l_orderkey 
WHERE 
    l_shipmode IN ('RAIL', 'TRUCK') 
    AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate 
    AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate 
    AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
    AND l_receiptdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1 year' 
GROUP BY 
    l_shipmode 
ORDER BY 
    l_shipmode;
```

### Applied Rules:

1. **Pushing Selections Down**: The conditions on `l_shipmode`, `l_commitdate`, `l_shipdate`, and `l_receiptdate` are included in the `WHERE` clause to reduce the number of rows joined from `orders` and `lineitem`.

2. **Using Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit join (comma-separated tables) to an explicit `JOIN` clause with an `ON` condition. This clarifies how the tables are related.

3. **Eliminating Redundant Operations**: Removed `LIMIT ALL` as it serves no purpose in limiting the result set.

These changes should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and improving clarity, making it easier to maintain and understand.
