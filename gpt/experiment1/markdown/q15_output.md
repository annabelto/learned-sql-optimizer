To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that simplify and potentially improve the performance of the query. Here are the steps and rules applied:

### Step 1: Inline View
Instead of creating and then dropping a view (`revenue0`), we can inline this view directly into the main query. This avoids the overhead of view creation and dropping, and can make the query easier to optimize for the query planner.

**Rule Applied**: View Merging (Inlining the view into the main query).

### Step 2: Simplify the `LIMIT ALL`
The `LIMIT ALL` clause is functionally equivalent to not having a `LIMIT` clause at all, as it does not limit the number of rows returned.

**Rule Applied**: Redundant Clause Elimination (removing `LIMIT ALL`).

### Step 3: Use Common Table Expression (CTE)
Instead of inlining the view directly in the FROM clause, using a CTE can make the query more readable and maintainable. It also allows the query planner to potentially optimize the query execution plan better.

**Rule Applied**: Transformation to CTE for better readability and potential optimization.

### Optimized Query
Here is the optimized query using the above rules:

```sql
WITH revenue0 AS (
    SELECT 
        l_suppkey AS supplier_no, 
        SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS total_revenue
    FROM 
        lineitem
    WHERE 
        l_shipdate >= DATE '1996-07-01' 
        AND l_shipdate < DATE '1996-07-01' + INTERVAL '3 months'
    GROUP BY 
        l_suppkey
)
SELECT 
    s_suppkey, 
    s_name, 
    s_address, 
    s_phone, 
    r.total_revenue
FROM 
    supplier s
JOIN 
    revenue0 r ON s.s_suppkey = r.supplier_no
WHERE 
    r.total_revenue = (SELECT MAX(total_revenue) FROM revenue0)
ORDER BY 
    s_suppkey;
```

### Explanation:
1. **CTE (`revenue0`)**: This CTE calculates the total revenue for each supplier based on the conditions provided. It replaces the original view creation.
2. **Main Query**: Joins the `supplier` table with the `revenue0` CTE. It filters to only include the supplier(s) with the maximum total revenue calculated in the CTE.
3. **Ordering and Selection**: The query orders the results by `s_suppkey` and selects the relevant columns.

This optimized query should perform similarly or better than the original, with improved readability and without the need for creating and dropping a view.
