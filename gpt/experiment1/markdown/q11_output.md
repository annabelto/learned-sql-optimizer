To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve performance without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (filters) closer to the data source. It is beneficial to apply filters as early as possible to reduce the size of intermediate results.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by calculating common expressions once and reusing the result.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, and if the filtering can be achieved by other means (e.g., using a subquery with an EXISTS clause), the join can be eliminated.

Here's the optimized query with explanations for each step:

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT ps_partkey, SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS value
FROM partsupp, supplier, nation
WHERE ps_suppkey = s_suppkey AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey AND n_name = 'FRANCE'
GROUP BY ps_partkey
HAVING SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (
    SELECT SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000
    FROM partsupp, supplier, nation
    WHERE ps_suppkey = s_suppkey AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey AND n_name = 'FRANCE'
)
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
Move the filter `n_name = 'FRANCE'` closer to the table `nation` to reduce the number of rows joined.

### Step 2: Common Sub-expression Elimination
The subquery in the `HAVING` clause is recalculating the sum for all qualifying rows for every group. Calculate it once and reuse.

### Step 3: Join Elimination
We can't eliminate any joins because all tables contribute to the final result.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH france_suppliers AS (
    SELECT s_suppkey
    FROM supplier
    JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    WHERE n_name = 'FRANCE'
),
total_value AS (
    SELECT SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000 AS threshold
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN france_suppliers ON ps_suppkey = france_suppliers.s_suppkey
)
SELECT ps_partkey, SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS value
FROM partsupp
JOIN france_suppliers ON ps_suppkey = france_suppliers.s_suppkey
GROUP BY ps_partkey
HAVING SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (SELECT threshold FROM total_value)
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation
- **france_suppliers**: This CTE filters out suppliers from France, reducing the number of rows for subsequent joins.
- **total_value**: This CTE calculates the threshold value once, which is used in the `HAVING` clause.
- The main query now uses these CTEs, reducing redundancy and improving performance by focusing only on relevant data.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data processing and elimination of redundant calculations.
