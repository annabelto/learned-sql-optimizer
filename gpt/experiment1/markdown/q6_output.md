To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that simplify and clarify the query without changing its semantics. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Constant Folding**: Simplify arithmetic expressions and constants.
2. **Predicate Simplification**: Simplify and clarify the range conditions in the WHERE clause.
3. **Redundant Clause Elimination**: Remove unnecessary clauses like `LIMIT ALL`.

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= date '1995-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.03 - 0.01 AND 0.03 + 0.01
  AND l_quantity < 25
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Step-by-Step Optimization

#### Step 1: Constant Folding
- Simplify `0.03 - 0.01` to `0.02` and `0.03 + 0.01` to `0.04`.
- Simplify `date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year` to `date '1996-01-01'`.

#### Step 2: Predicate Simplification
- The BETWEEN clause for `l_discount` can be rewritten for clarity using explicit range values obtained from constant folding.

#### Step 3: Redundant Clause Elimination
- `LIMIT ALL` is redundant because it essentially means no limit on the number of rows returned. Since this is the default behavior in SQL when no LIMIT is specified, we can remove this clause.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= date '1995-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < date '1996-01-01'
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.02 AND 0.04
  AND l_quantity < 25;
```

### Explanation of Applied Rules
- **Constant Folding** was used to simplify the arithmetic expressions in the date and discount calculations.
- **Predicate Simplification** was applied to make the range checks more straightforward and readable.
- **Redundant Clause Elimination** was used to remove the `LIMIT ALL` clause, which does not affect the query result but simplifies the syntax.

This optimized query should perform the same as the original but is clearer and potentially more efficient due to the simplified conditions and reduced complexity in parsing and planning the query execution.
