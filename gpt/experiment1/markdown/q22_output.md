To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that simplify and reduce the complexity of the query without changing its semantics. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (conditions) as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data processed in the upper layers of the query.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by reusing the results of common sub-expressions.

3. **Simplifying Aggregate Functions**: This involves simplifying the nested aggregate functions if possible.

Here's the original query:

```sql
SELECT cntrycode, COUNT(*) AS numcust, SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal
FROM (
    SELECT substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode, c_acctbal
    FROM customer
    WHERE substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
      AND c_acctbal > (
          SELECT AVG(c_acctbal)
          FROM customer
          WHERE c_acctbal > 0.00
            AND substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
      )
      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT *
          FROM orders
          WHERE o_custkey = c_custkey
      )
) AS custsale
GROUP BY cntrycode
ORDER BY cntrycode
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
We can push the condition `substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')` into the subquery used for calculating the average account balance. This reduces the number of rows processed in the subquery.

### Step 2: Common Sub-expression Elimination
The subquery for calculating the average account balance is executed for each row, but it can be computed once and reused. We can calculate this average in a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a subquery in the FROM clause.

### Optimized Query.
```sql
WITH avg_acctbal AS (
    SELECT AVG(c_acctbal) AS avg_balance
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_acctbal > 0.00
      AND substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
)
SELECT cntrycode, COUNT(*) AS numcust, SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal
FROM (
    SELECT substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode, c_acctbal
    FROM customer
    WHERE substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
      AND c_acctbal > (SELECT avg_balance FROM avg_acctbal)
      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1
          FROM orders
          WHERE o_custkey = c_custkey
      )
) AS custsale
GROUP BY cntrycode
ORDER BY cntrycode
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:
- **CTE `avg_acctbal`**: This computes the average account balance once for all qualifying customers, which is then used in the main query.
- **Subquery in FROM clause**: This is used to filter customers based on the computed average balance and other conditions.
- **NOT EXISTS**: Changed to `SELECT 1` as it's a common practice to use `SELECT 1` in EXISTS clauses for clarity and potentially slight performance improvement, though the effect is typically negligible.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced redundancy and more efficient data processing.
