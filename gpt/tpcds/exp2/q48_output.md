To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the complexity and potentially improving the execution plan generated by PostgreSQL. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows early in the execution plan, which can decrease the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages.

2. **Conjunction Normal Form (CNF)**: This rule simplifies the logical AND and OR conditions. It can help the database optimizer better understand and optimize the query.

3. **Join Reordering**: Based on the selectivity of the joins and the size of the tables, reordering the joins can help in reducing the size of intermediate results, which can lead to faster query execution.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Conditions**: If there are any redundant conditions, they should be eliminated to simplify the query.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT SUM(ss_quantity)
FROM 
  store_sales
JOIN 
  date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN 
  store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
  customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = ss_cdemo_sk
JOIN 
  customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
WHERE 
  d_year = 2001
  AND ca_country = 'United States'
  AND (
    (cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 100.00 AND 150.00) OR
    (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00) OR
    (cd_marital_status = 'D' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 150.00 AND 200.00)
  )
  AND (
    (ca_state IN ('ND', 'NY', 'SD') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 0 AND 2000) OR
    (ca_state IN ('MD', 'GA', 'KS') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 150 AND 3000) OR
    (ca_state IN ('CO', 'MN', 'NC') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 50 AND 25000)
  );
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Join Conditions**: Moved the join conditions directly into the `JOIN` clauses for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to move conditions on `d_year`, `ca_country`, and other filters directly after the relevant joins to reduce row counts early.
- **Conjunction Normal Form**: The query was already close to CNF, but ensuring that ANDs and ORs are properly grouped helps maintain clarity and potentially aids the optimizer.
- **Join Reordering**: Not explicitly shown, but by organizing joins logically (e.g., linking `date_dim` and `store_sales` early), we can potentially reduce the size of intermediate datasets.

This rewritten query should be more efficient in terms of execution, given that it reduces the complexity and volume of data being processed at each step.
