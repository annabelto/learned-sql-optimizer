To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the `ON` clause of joins or as close as possible to the data sources. This reduces the number of rows processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not affect the final result.

3. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to reduce the size of intermediate results, which can decrease the overall query execution time.

4. **Use of EXISTS instead of JOIN**: When checking for existence, using `EXISTS` can be more efficient than a join, especially if the selectivity is high.

5. **Aggregation before a join**: Perform aggregation as early as possible to reduce the volume of data being joined.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_desc,
    w_warehouse_name,
    d1.d_week_seq,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo,
    COUNT(*) AS total_cnt
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    inventory ON cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk
JOIN 
    warehouse ON w_warehouse_sk = inv_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk AND hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000'
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk AND d1.d_year = 1998
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    promotion ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    catalog_returns ON cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND cr_order_number = cs_order_number
WHERE 
    inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity
GROUP BY 
    i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq
ORDER BY 
    total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved conditions related to `customer_demographics`, `household_demographics`, and `date_dim` into the respective `JOIN` clauses.
- **Join Reordering**: Not explicitly shown, but assumed based on the query's structure and the nature of the data (e.g., smaller dimension tables like `item` and `warehouse` are joined early).
- **Aggregation before a join**: Not applicable here as aggregation is inherently dependent on the results of multiple tables due to the nature of the query.

These optimizations aim to reduce the amount of data being processed and the complexity of joins, potentially leading to faster query execution times.
