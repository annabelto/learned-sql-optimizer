To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution plan.
2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Remove or simplify redundant expressions or conditions.
3. **Constant Folding**: Evaluate expressions involving constants at compile time rather than at runtime.
4. **Join Condition Simplification**: Simplify join conditions and ensure they are using the most efficient types of joins.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query has several areas where these rules can be applied:
- The `date_dim.d_year` condition repeats the value `2000` multiple times.
- The `store.s_county` condition redundantly lists 'Williamson County' multiple times.
- The `household_demographics.hd_buy_potential` condition checks for two values which can be simplified using an `IN` clause.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: 
   - Push conditions related to `date_dim`, `store`, and `household_demographics` directly into the subquery where the tables are joined.

2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**:
   - Simplify the repeated `2000` in `date_dim.d_year` and the repeated 'Williamson County' in `store.s_county`.

3. **Constant Folding**:
   - Simplify the `date_dim.d_year` condition by calculating the years directly.

4. **Join Condition Simplification**:
   - Ensure that the join conditions are straightforward and use efficient joins.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    c_salutation,
    c_preferred_cust_flag,
    ss_ticket_number,
    cnt
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
    JOIN 
        household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    WHERE 
        (date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 3 OR date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 25 AND 28)
        AND (household_demographics.hd_buy_potential IN ('1001-5000', '0-500'))
        AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0
        AND (CASE 
                WHEN household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 THEN household_demographics.hd_dep_count / household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count 
                ELSE NULL 
             END) > 1.2
        AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
        AND store.s_county = 'Williamson County'
    GROUP BY 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk
) dn
JOIN 
    customer ON dn.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
WHERE 
    cnt BETWEEN 15 AND 20
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    c_salutation,
    c_preferred_cust_flag DESC,
    ss_ticket_number;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced redundancy and more efficient data processing steps.
