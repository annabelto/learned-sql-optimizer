To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the rules and the order in which they are applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subquery where they are relevant. This reduces the amount of data processed in the outer queries.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries.
3. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify or reorganize expressions to make them more efficient.
4. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if the join keys and filters guarantee that all rows must have a match.
5. **Use of Window Functions**: Efficient use of window functions to avoid self-joins when calculating lag and lead values.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_moy, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_year) AS avg_monthly_sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name ORDER BY d_year, d_moy) AS rn
    FROM 
        item
    JOIN 
        store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2000 OR 
        (d_year = 1999 AND d_moy = 12) OR 
        (d_year = 2001 AND d_moy = 1)
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_year, d_moy
), 
v2 AS (
    SELECT 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_year, 
        avg_monthly_sales, 
        sum_sales,
        LAG(sum_sales) OVER w AS psum,
        LEAD(sum_sales) OVER w AS nsum
    FROM 
        v1
    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name ORDER BY rn)
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    v2
WHERE 
    d_year = 2000 AND 
    avg_monthly_sales > 0 AND 
    ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    nsum
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the `d_year` filter into the subquery `v1` to reduce the data processed.
- **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Eliminated the need for self-joins in `v2` by using window functions `LAG` and `LEAD` directly in the definition of `v2`.
- **Simplify Expressions**: Simplified the date conditions in the `WHERE` clause.
- **Join Elimination**: Not applied as all joins are necessary for the correct results.
- **Use of Window Functions**: Used `LAG` and `LEAD` to avoid additional self-joins, making the query more efficient.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage of the query.
