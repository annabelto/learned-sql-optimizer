To optimize the given PostgreSQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates (filters) as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: Adjust the order of joins based on the size of the tables and the selectivity of the join conditions. This can reduce the size of intermediate results and improve overall query performance.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax. This improves readability and can help the database optimizer understand the query structure better.

4. **Elimination of Redundant GROUP BY Columns**: If certain columns in the GROUP BY clause do not affect the aggregation results, they can be removed to simplify the grouping operation.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category,
    AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    inventory ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON inv_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP(i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category)
ORDER BY 
    qoh, i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: The filter `d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1200 + 11` is directly applied in the WHERE clause, ensuring that only relevant rows from `date_dim` are considered early in the execution.

- **Join Reordering**: Although the exact sizes of the tables are not known, typically, dimension tables like `item` and `date_dim` are smaller or have more selective filters compared to transactional tables like `inventory`. Thus, joining `item` and `date_dim` first might reduce the size of the dataset before it's joined with `inventory`.

- **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query now uses explicit JOIN syntax (`JOIN ... ON ...`), which is generally more readable and preferred over implicit joins.

- **Elimination of Redundant GROUP BY Columns**: No columns were removed from the GROUP BY clause in this case, as it appears all are potentially necessary for the rollup operation to produce the desired detailed and summary results.

These optimizations should help in improving the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data processed and clarifying the join conditions for the query planner.
