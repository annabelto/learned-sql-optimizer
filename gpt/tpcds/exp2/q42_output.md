To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter conditions as close as possible to the data source. By applying filters early, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to reduce the size of intermediate results. It's particularly effective when there are multiple joins that can be reordered to minimize the data that needs to be joined.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax (e.g., INNER JOIN) for better readability and control over join conditions.

4. **Column Pruning**: Ensuring only the necessary columns are selected from each table to reduce the amount of data being processed.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    store_sales ss ON item.i_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim dt ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = dt.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    item.i_manager_id = 1
    AND dt.d_moy = 11
    AND dt.d_year = 1998
GROUP BY 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category
ORDER BY 
    total_sales DESC,
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the conditions `item.i_manager_id = 1`, `dt.d_moy = 11`, and `dt.d_year = 1998` directly into the WHERE clause to filter rows as early as possible.

2. **Join Reordering**: Although the optimal join order depends on the data distribution and the database's query planner, I assumed that filtering `item` first (based on `i_manager_id`), then joining `store_sales`, and finally `date_dim` might be efficient due to the selective nature of `i_manager_id`.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the query to use explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and to ensure that the join conditions are correctly associated with each join.

4. **Column Pruning**: Only the necessary columns are included in the SELECT and JOIN clauses, reducing the amount of data processed.

These changes should help in optimizing the query execution by reducing the amount of data loaded and processed, and by making the query execution plan more efficient.
