To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data scanned and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: The query includes redundant expressions in the `IN` clause for `cc_county`. This can be simplified.

3. **Use Explicit JOINs Instead of Commas**: Using explicit JOIN syntax improves readability and often execution plans, as it clearly specifies the type of joins.

4. **Simplify Date Operations**: The date operation can be simplified by directly using the resultant date instead of adding days to a cast date.

5. **Remove Redundant DISTINCT**: Since `count(distinct cs_order_number)` is used in both the SELECT and ORDER BY clauses, ensure it's computed once.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT cs1.cs_order_number) AS "order count",
    SUM(cs1.cs_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
    SUM(cs1.cs_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM 
    catalog_sales cs1
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs1.cs_ship_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON cs1.cs_ship_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    call_center ON cs1.cs_call_center_sk = call_center.cc_call_center_sk
WHERE 
    date_dim.d_date BETWEEN '2002-04-01' AND '2002-05-31' -- Simplified date operation
    AND customer_address.ca_state = 'PA'
    AND call_center.cc_county = 'Williamson County' -- Eliminated redundant expressions
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM catalog_sales cs2
        WHERE cs1.cs_order_number = cs2.cs_order_number
          AND cs1.cs_warehouse_sk <> cs2.cs_warehouse_sk
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM catalog_returns cr1
        WHERE cs1.cs_order_number = cr1.cr_order_number
    )
ORDER BY 
    "order count"
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied by moving join conditions and filters directly after the relevant table mentions.
- **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Simplified the `IN` clause for `cc_county`.
- **Explicit JOINs**: Changed the comma-separated table list to explicit JOINs, which helps in understanding and optimizing the query execution plan.
- **Simplify Date Operations**: Changed the date addition to a direct date range, which is easier to understand and potentially benefits from index usage.
- **Remove Redundant DISTINCT**: Ensured that the `DISTINCT` operation is efficiently handled by not repeating it unnecessarily.

These changes should help in improving the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data processed and making better use of indexes and execution plans.
