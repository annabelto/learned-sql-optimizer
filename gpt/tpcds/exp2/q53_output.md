To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify or precompute expressions where possible to reduce complexity during query execution.
3. **Eliminate Redundant Operations**: Remove or combine unnecessary operations to streamline execution.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple joins and a complex WHERE clause with multiple conditions. It also uses window functions and conditional logic in the outer query.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
Push conditions on `date_dim`, `item`, and `store_sales` closer to their respective tables in the FROM clause. This reduces the number of rows early in the query processing.

#### Step 2: Simplify Expressions
The expression `d_month_seq in (1186,1186+1,...,1186+11)` can be simplified to `d_month_seq BETWEEN 1186 AND 1197`.

#### Step 3: Eliminate Redundant Operations
The subquery computes both `sum(ss_sales_price)` and `avg(sum(ss_sales_price))` but the outer query filters based on a condition derived from these values. We can compute the necessary values directly in the subquery, avoiding the need for a CASE statement in the outer query.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT i_manufact_id, sum_sales, avg_quarterly_sales
FROM (
    SELECT i_manufact_id, 
           SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, 
           AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manufact_id) AS avg_quarterly_sales
    FROM item
    JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1186 AND 1197
      AND (
          (i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') 
           AND i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help') 
           AND i_brand IN ('scholaramalgamalg #14', 'scholaramalgamalg #7', 'exportiunivamalg #9', 'scholaramalgamalg #9'))
        OR
          (i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men') 
           AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants') 
           AND i_brand IN ('amalgimporto #1', 'edu packscholar #1', 'exportiimporto #1', 'importoamalg #1'))
      )
    GROUP BY i_manufact_id
) AS tmp1
WHERE ABS(sum_sales - avg_quarterly_sales) / avg_quarterly_sales > 0.1
ORDER BY avg_quarterly_sales, sum_sales, i_manufact_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions related to `date_dim`, `item`, and `store_sales` are moved closer to the respective table joins.
- **Simplify Expressions**: The range for `d_month_seq` is simplified using `BETWEEN`.
- **Eliminate Redundant Operations**: The CASE statement in the outer query is removed by directly using the computed columns in the WHERE clause, simplifying the logic and potentially improving performance.
