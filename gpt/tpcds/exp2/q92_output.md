To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. The rules include predicate pushdown, common subexpression elimination, and using joins instead of subqueries where applicable. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the upper layers of the query.

2. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by calculating common expressions once and reusing the result.

3. **Join Conversion**: Convert subqueries to joins where possible, as joins are generally more efficient in execution than correlated subqueries, especially in analytical queries like those in TPC-DS.

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT sum(ws_ext_discount_amt) AS "Excess Discount Amount"
FROM web_sales, item, date_dim
WHERE i_manufact_id = 714
  AND i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
  AND d_date BETWEEN '2000-02-01' AND (CAST('2000-02-01' AS DATE) + 90)
  AND d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
  AND ws_ext_discount_amt > (
    SELECT 1.3 * avg(ws_ext_discount_amt)
    FROM web_sales, date_dim
    WHERE ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
      AND d_date BETWEEN '2000-02-01' AND (CAST('2000-02-01' AS DATE) + 90)
      AND d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
  )
ORDER BY sum(ws_ext_discount_amt)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Step-by-Step Optimization

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
Push predicates into the subquery to reduce the amount of data processed.

#### Step 2: Common Subexpression Elimination
Identify the common date range expression and the join condition on `date_dim` and `web_sales`.

#### Step 3: Join Conversion
Convert the subquery into a join.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH avg_discount AS (
  SELECT 1.3 * avg(ws_ext_discount_amt) AS avg_disc
  FROM web_sales
  JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-02-01' AND (CAST('2000-02-01' AS DATE) + 90)
)
SELECT sum(ws_ext_discount_amt) AS "Excess Discount Amount"
FROM web_sales
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
JOIN avg_discount ON ws_ext_discount_amt > avg_discount.avg_disc
WHERE i_manufact_id = 714
  AND d_date BETWEEN '2000-02-01' AND (CAST('2000-02-01' AS DATE) + 90)
ORDER BY sum(ws_ext_discount_amt)
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query should perform better due to the reduced number of rows processed in the main query and the elimination of the correlated subquery, which is now handled more efficiently as a join.
