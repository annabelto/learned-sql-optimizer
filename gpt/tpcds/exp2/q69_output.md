To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules include simplifying joins, using explicit JOIN syntax for clarity, pushing predicates into subqueries, and eliminating redundant GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

### Optimization Steps:

1. **Use Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace implicit joins with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control over join behavior.
2. **Push Predicate into Subqueries**: Move predicates that filter data in subqueries closer to the source to reduce the amount of data processed and joined in the outer query.
3. **Eliminate Redundant COUNT(*)**: Since the same COUNT(*) operation is repeated, we can compute it once and reuse the result if applicable.
4. **Simplify BETWEEN Usage**: Simplify the usage of the BETWEEN operator in the subqueries for clarity.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    COUNT(*) AS cnt1, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd_credit_rating
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd ON cd.cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk
WHERE 
    ca.ca_state IN ('IL', 'TX', 'ME')
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM 
            store_sales ss
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = ss.ss_customer_sk
            AND d.d_year = 2002
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM 
            web_sales ws
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = ws.ws_bill_customer_sk
            AND d.d_year = 2002
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM 
            catalog_sales cs
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = cs.cs_ship_customer_sk
            AND d.d_year = 2002
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
GROUP BY 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd_credit_rating
ORDER BY 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd_credit_rating
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit JOINs**: The query now uses explicit JOINs, which are generally preferred for clarity and can help the database optimizer understand the query structure better.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The predicates related to the year and month of sales are pushed down into the EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be fetched and processed in the main query.
- **Simplified COUNT(*)**: The query now calculates `COUNT(*)` once per group, as the multiple counts were redundant and could potentially confuse the optimizer or lead to unnecessary computation.
- **Simplified BETWEEN**: The `BETWEEN` usage is simplified by directly specifying the range, making the query easier to understand and potentially aiding the optimizer in using indexes effectively.

These optimizations should help improve the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data processed and making better use of indexes and join strategies.
