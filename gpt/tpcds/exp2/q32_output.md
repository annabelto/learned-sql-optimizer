To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows early in the execution plan, which decreases the amount of data processed and transferred in later stages.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, it can sometimes be eliminated or simplified.

3. **Subquery Factorization**: Common subexpressions, especially in subqueries, can be computed once and reused, reducing the total computation.

4. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit joins (using JOIN keyword) can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it makes the join conditions clearer and allows the optimizer to better understand the query structure.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Push conditions on `date_dim` and `item` tables as close to their respective table sources as possible.
2. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Convert the implicit joins to explicit joins for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
3. **Subquery Factorization**: The subquery is used to calculate a threshold value based on `catalog_sales` and `date_dim`. This value can be calculated once and reused.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH threshold AS (
    SELECT 1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS avg_discount
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2001-03-09' AND ('2001-03-09'::date + INTERVAL '90 days')
)
SELECT SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
JOIN threshold ON true
WHERE i_manufact_id = 722
  AND d_date BETWEEN '2001-03-09' AND ('2001-03-09'::date + INTERVAL '90 days')
  AND cs_ext_discount_amt > threshold.avg_discount
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **WITH clause (Subquery Factorization)**: The average discount calculation is factored out into a common table expression (CTE) named `threshold`. This calculation is performed once and joined with the main query.
- **Explicit Joins**: The query now uses explicit JOIN syntax, which helps in understanding the join conditions directly.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions related to dates and item keys are kept close to their respective table references, which can help in reducing the row set early in the query execution.

This rewritten query should be more efficient in terms of execution, especially with large datasets, as it minimizes the amount of data being processed by filtering early and reducing redundant calculations.
