To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the semantics of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source to reduce the amount of data processed and transferred.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries that are repeated within the query.
3. **Join Simplification**: Simplify joins, especially focusing on reducing the scope of full outer joins if possible.
4. **Window Function Optimization**: Optimize the use of window functions by checking if they can be simplified or computed in a more efficient manner.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query has two main parts defined in CTEs (`web_v1` and `store_v1`) that compute cumulative sales from `web_sales` and `store_sales` tables, respectively. It then performs a full outer join on these results and computes cumulative maximum sales for both web and store sales, filtering the results where web cumulative sales are greater than store cumulative sales.

### Applying Rewrite Rules

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown
We can push the predicates related to `d_month_seq` and `item_sk` into the CTEs to reduce the amount of data processed in each CTE.

#### 2. Common Sub-expression Elimination
The calculation of `d_month_seq between 1212 and 1212+11` is repeated; we can compute this once and use it in both CTEs.

#### 3. Join Simplification
The full outer join is necessary due to the nature of the data merging from web and store sales, so minimal simplification is possible here.

#### 4. Window Function Optimization
The window functions are already optimized as they use the most efficient form of window specification.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH date_range AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1212 AND 1223
),
web_v1 AS (
    SELECT ws_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, 
           SUM(ws_sales_price) OVER (PARTITION BY ws_item_sk ORDER BY d_date 
                                     ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cume_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_range ON ws_sold_date_sk = date_range.d_date_sk
    WHERE ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY ws_item_sk, d_date
),
store_v1 AS (
    SELECT ss_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, 
           SUM(ss_sales_price) OVER (PARTITION BY ss_item_sk ORDER BY d_date 
                                     ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cume_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_range ON ss_sold_date_sk = date_range.d_date_sk
    WHERE ss_item_sk IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY ss_item_sk, d_date
)
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT item_sk, d_date, web_sales, store_sales,
           MAX(web_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date 
                                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS web_cumulative,
           MAX(store_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date 
                                  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS store_cumulative
    FROM (
        SELECT COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) AS item_sk,
               COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) AS d_date,
               web.cume_sales AS web_sales,
               store.cume_sales AS store_sales
        FROM web_v1 web
        FULL OUTER JOIN store_v1 store ON web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date
    ) x
) y
WHERE web_cumulative > store_cumulative
ORDER BY item_sk, d_date
LIMIT 100;
```

In this optimized query, I have introduced a `date_range` CTE to avoid repeated calculations and pushed relevant predicates closer to the data sources in the `web_v1` and `store_v1` CTEs. This should help in reducing the computational overhead and improve the overall performance of the query.
