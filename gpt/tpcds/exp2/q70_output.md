To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving predicates closer to the data source, reducing the amount of data processed in the upper layers of the query.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identifying and reusing intermediate results that are computed more than once.
3. **Eliminating Redundant Joins and Subqueries**: Simplifying or removing unnecessary joins and subqueries that do not contribute to the final result.
4. **Simplifying Expressions and Case Statements**: Reducing complexity in expressions and case statements when possible.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple joins and a subquery that filters states based on a ranking condition. The subquery itself includes a window function and aggregates, which are computed over the same tables and columns as the outer query.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We can push the condition `d_month_seq between 1220 and 1220+11` directly into the subquery to reduce the amount of data processed.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: The subquery used to filter states by ranking is based on the same joins and filters as the outer query. We can compute this once and reuse the result.

3. **Eliminating Redundant Joins and Subqueries**: The join conditions and the filters are repeated; these can be computed once and reused, reducing the complexity and execution time.

4. **Simplifying Expressions and Case Statements**: The case statement in the `ORDER BY` clause of the outer query can be simplified if the logic is straightforward and does not change the outcome.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH FilteredStates AS (
    SELECT s_state
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231
    GROUP BY s_state
    ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) DESC
    LIMIT 5
),
AggregatedData AS (
    SELECT
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS total_sum,
        s_state,
        s_county,
        grouping(s_state) + grouping(s_county) AS lochierarchy,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY grouping(s_state) + grouping(s_county), s_state
            ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) DESC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231 AND s_state IN (SELECT s_state FROM FilteredStates)
    GROUP BY ROLLUP(s_state, s_county)
)
SELECT *
FROM AggregatedData
ORDER BY lochierarchy DESC, s_state, rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation
- **WITH Clauses**: Used to define `FilteredStates` and `AggregatedData` to avoid redundant computation and improve readability.
- **FilteredStates**: Computes the top 5 states based on net profit once and reuses this result.
- **AggregatedData**: Performs the main aggregation and ranking logic.
- **Final SELECT**: Simplifies the ordering by removing unnecessary case statements and directly using the computed columns.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced redundancy and more efficient data processing.
