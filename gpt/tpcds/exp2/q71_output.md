To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include predicate pushdown, common subexpression elimination, and simplifying joins. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the base tables in the subqueries. This reduces the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy in the subqueries. Since the structure of the subqueries for `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `store_sales` are similar, we can simplify the query by applying filters directly in the subqueries.

3. **Simplifying Joins**: By ensuring that joins are only performed on necessary columns, we can reduce the complexity and cost of the join operations.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
    i.i_brand AS brand,
    t.t_hour,
    t.t_minute, 
    SUM(tmp.ext_price) AS ext_price 
FROM 
    item i
JOIN 
    (SELECT 
         ws.ws_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, 
         ws.ws_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, 
         ws.ws_sold_time_sk AS time_sk 
     FROM 
         web_sales ws
     JOIN 
         date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ws.ws_sold_date_sk
     WHERE 
         d.d_moy = 12 AND d.d_year = 2002

     UNION ALL

     SELECT 
         cs.cs_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, 
         cs.cs_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, 
         cs.cs_sold_time_sk AS time_sk 
     FROM 
         catalog_sales cs
     JOIN 
         date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = cs.cs_sold_date_sk
     WHERE 
         d.d_moy = 12 AND d.d_year = 2002

     UNION ALL

     SELECT 
         ss.ss_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, 
         ss.ss_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, 
         ss.ss_sold_time_sk AS time_sk 
     FROM 
         store_sales ss
     JOIN 
         date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
     WHERE 
         d.d_moy = 12 AND d.d_year = 2002
    ) tmp ON i.i_item_sk = tmp.sold_item_sk
JOIN 
    time_dim t ON tmp.time_sk = t.t_time_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_manager_id = 1 AND 
    (t.t_meal_time = 'breakfast' OR t.t_meal_time = 'dinner')
GROUP BY 
    i.i_brand, i.i_brand_id, t.t_hour, t.t_minute
ORDER BY 
    SUM(tmp.ext_price) DESC, i.i_brand_id;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the conditions `d.d_moy = 12` and `d.d_year = 2002` into each subquery for `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `store_sales`.
- **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Eliminated the redundant joins by directly joining `date_dim` in each subquery.
- **Simplifying Joins**: Ensured that joins are only on necessary columns and simplified the overall structure of the query.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage of the query by minimizing the amount of data being processed and transferred across different parts of the query execution plan.
