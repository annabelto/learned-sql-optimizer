To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter conditions closer to the data source. It reduces the amount of data processed by filtering rows earlier in the execution plan.
2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated to reduce complexity.
3. **Column Pruning**: Select only the necessary columns in the subqueries to reduce the amount of data being processed and transferred.
4. **Using Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This can make the query clearer and sometimes allows the optimizer to more efficiently plan the joins.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query joins `web_sales`, `date_dim`, and `item`, filters on `d_month_seq`, and groups by a rollup of `i_category` and `i_class`. It also uses window functions to calculate rankings within groups.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the date filtering closer to the `date_dim` table scan.
2. **Column Pruning**: In the subquery, only select columns that are necessary for the final output or conditions.
3. **Using Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

### Optimized Query
```sql
### Optimized Query
SELECT 
    sub.total_sum,
    sub.i_category,
    sub.i_class,
    sub.lochierarchy,
    sub.rank_within_parent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ws.ws_net_paid) AS total_sum,
        i.i_category,
        i.i_class,
        GROUPING(i.i_category) + GROUPING(i.i_class) AS lochierarchy,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY GROUPING(i.i_category) + GROUPING(i.i_class), 
            CASE WHEN GROUPING(i.i_class) = 0 THEN i.i_category END 
            ORDER BY SUM(ws.ws_net_paid) DESC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        web_sales ws
        JOIN date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ws.ws_sold_date_sk
        JOIN item i ON i.i_item_sk = ws.ws_item_sk
    WHERE 
        d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1186 AND 1197
    GROUP BY 
        ROLLUP(i.i_category, i.i_class)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    sub.lochierarchy DESC, 
    CASE WHEN sub.lochierarchy = 0 THEN sub.i_category END, 
    sub.rank_within_parent 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The `WHERE` clause condition on `d_month_seq` is directly linked with the `JOIN` condition, ensuring that filtering happens as early as possible.
- **Column Pruning**: The subquery only selects columns that are necessary for computing the final result.
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query uses explicit `JOIN` conditions, which can help in understanding and potentially optimizing the execution plan.

These changes should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage of the query by minimizing the amount of data processed and clearly defining join conditions.
