To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules include eliminating redundant subqueries, using explicit JOINs instead of implicit ones, and pushing predicates early. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. **Eliminate Redundant Subqueries**: The subquery `sc` is defined and used in the main query, but it is computed twice - once inside another subquery `sb` and once directly in the FROM clause. We can compute it once and reuse the result.

2. **Use Explicit JOINs**: Replace implicit JOINs (comma-separated FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax to clarify the join conditions and potentially allow the optimizer to better understand the query structure.

3. **Push Predicate Early**: Apply filters as early as possible in subqueries to reduce the size of intermediate results, which can reduce the overall query execution time.

4. **Column Pruning**: Ensure that only necessary columns are fetched in subqueries to reduce data shuffling and improve performance.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH revenue_subquery AS (
    SELECT 
        ss_store_sk, 
        ss_item_sk, 
        sum(ss_sales_price) AS revenue
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1176 AND 1176 + 11
    GROUP BY 
        ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
),
average_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        ss_store_sk, 
        avg(revenue) AS ave
    FROM 
        revenue_subquery
    GROUP BY 
        ss_store_sk
)
SELECT 
    s_store_name, 
    i_item_desc, 
    sc.revenue, 
    i_current_price, 
    i_wholesale_cost, 
    i_brand
FROM 
    store
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
JOIN 
    revenue_subquery sc ON s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    average_revenue sb ON sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk
WHERE 
    sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave
ORDER BY 
    s_store_name, 
    i_item_desc
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **WITH Clauses**: Introduced `revenue_subquery` to eliminate redundancy by computing the revenue sum once and reused it in `average_revenue` and the main query.
- **Explicit JOINs**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit JOINs for better readability and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The filter on `d_month_seq` is applied directly in the `revenue_subquery` to reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent steps.
- **Column Pruning**: Only necessary columns are selected in the subqueries to minimize data handling.

These changes should make the query more efficient by reducing redundancy, clarifying join conditions, and minimizing the amount of data processed and transferred.
