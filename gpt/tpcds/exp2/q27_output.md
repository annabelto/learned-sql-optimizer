To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data processed by filtering rows early in the execution plan.
2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Remove or simplify redundant expressions to reduce the complexity of the query.
3. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to minimize the size of intermediate results, which can reduce the overall query execution time.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) AS g_state, 
       avg(ss_quantity) AS agg1, avg(ss_list_price) AS agg2, 
       avg(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, avg(ss_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, store, item 
WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
  AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
  AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk 
  AND ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk 
  AND cd_gender = 'M' 
  AND cd_marital_status = 'W' 
  AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary' 
  AND d_year = 1999 
  AND s_state IN ('TN') 
GROUP BY ROLLUP (i_item_id, s_state) 
ORDER BY i_item_id, s_state 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   - Push conditions related to `customer_demographics`, `date_dim`, and `store` directly into the respective joins.

2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**:
   - Simplify the `IN` clause in `s_state IN ('TN')` since it contains duplicate values.

3. **Join Reordering**:
   - Although the optimal join order depends on the database statistics and indexes, a common heuristic is to join smaller tables or the ones with more restrictive filters earlier. Assuming typical TPC-DS data distributions, we might start with `date_dim` and `customer_demographics` due to their filters.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) AS g_state, 
       avg(ss_quantity) AS agg1, avg(ss_list_price) AS agg2, 
       avg(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, avg(ss_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM 
  (SELECT * FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 1999) date_dim
JOIN 
  (SELECT * FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary') customer_demographics 
  ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
  store_sales ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN 
  item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
  (SELECT * FROM store WHERE s_state = 'TN') store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
GROUP BY ROLLUP (i_item_id, s_state) 
ORDER BY i_item_id, s_state 
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query should perform better due to early filtering and reduced redundancy, which minimizes the amount of data flowing through the joins and group by operations.
