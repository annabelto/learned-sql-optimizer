To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution plan.
2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Remove duplicate expressions or conditions that are repeated.
3. **Simplifying Joins**: Simplify the join conditions and reduce the number of joins if possible by analyzing the relationships and constraints.
4. **Projection Pushdown**: Limit the columns retrieved in the initial stages of the query to only those necessary for the final result.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple joins and complex conditions. The query also uses a combination of attributes from different tables to filter and aggregate data. The use of `substr` in both the SELECT and ORDER BY clauses is redundant and can be simplified.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown
We push predicates related to `d_year`, `ws_sales_price`, and `ws_net_profit` closer to their respective table scans. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be joined in later stages.

#### 2. Redundant Expression Elimination
The conditions `cd1.cd_marital_status = cd2.cd_marital_status` and `cd1.cd_education_status = cd2.cd_education_status` are repeated across different OR conditions. We can simplify this by checking these conditions once before the specific checks for marital status and education status.

#### 3. Simplifying Joins
The joins do not seem to be reducible without additional schema information, but ensuring that the joins are performed on indexed columns would be beneficial.

#### 4. Projection Pushdown
Only select the necessary columns early in the query to reduce the amount of data being processed and moved around during the join and aggregation phases.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT
    substr(r_reason_desc, 1, 20),
    AVG(ws_quantity),
    AVG(wr_refunded_cash),
    AVG(wr_fee)
FROM
    web_sales
JOIN
    web_returns ON ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk AND ws_order_number = wr_order_number
JOIN
    web_page ON ws_web_page_sk = wp_web_page_sk
JOIN
    customer_demographics cd1 ON cd1.cd_demo_sk = wr_refunded_cdemo_sk
JOIN
    customer_demographics cd2 ON cd2.cd_demo_sk = wr_returning_cdemo_sk AND cd1.cd_marital_status = cd2.cd_marital_status AND cd1.cd_education_status = cd2.cd_education_status
JOIN
    customer_address ON ca_address_sk = wr_refunded_addr_sk
JOIN
    date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 1998
JOIN
    reason ON r_reason_sk = wr_reason_sk
WHERE
    (
        (cd1.cd_marital_status = 'D' AND cd1.cd_education_status = 'Primary' AND ws_sales_price BETWEEN 100.00 AND 150.00) OR
        (cd1.cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd1.cd_education_status = 'College' AND ws_sales_price BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00) OR
        (cd1.cd_marital_status = 'U' AND cd1.cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree' AND ws_sales_price BETWEEN 150.00 AND 200.00)
    ) AND
    (
        (ca_country = 'United States' AND ca_state IN ('NC', 'TX', 'IA') AND ws_net_profit BETWEEN 100 AND 200) OR
        (ca_country = 'United States' AND ca_state IN ('WI', 'WV', 'GA') AND ws_net_profit BETWEEN 150 AND 300) OR
        (ca_country = 'United States' AND ca_state IN ('OK', 'VA', 'KY') AND ws_net_profit BETWEEN 50 AND 250)
    )
GROUP BY
    r_reason_desc
ORDER BY
    substr(r_reason_desc, 1, 20),
    AVG(ws_quantity),
    AVG(wr_refunded_cash),
    AVG(wr_fee)
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data movement and earlier data filtering.
