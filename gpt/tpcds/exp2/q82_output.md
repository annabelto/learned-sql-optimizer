To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to reduce the size of intermediate results, which can decrease the overall query execution time.
3. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and often better performance due to clearer join conditions.
4. **Elimination of Redundant Group By**: If the grouping columns are functionally dependent on the primary keys or unique columns, the group by might be redundant.
5. **Limit Pushdown**: Apply the limit as early as possible to reduce the amount of data processed.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
FROM item, inventory, date_dim, store_sales
WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 58 AND 58 + 30
  AND inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND d_date_sk = inv_date_sk
  AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2001-01-13' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2001-01-13' AS DATE) + 60)
  AND i_manufact_id IN (259, 559, 580, 485)
  AND inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
  AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
ORDER BY i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Use of Explicit Joins**:
   Convert implicit joins to explicit joins for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   Push predicates related to `inventory` and `date_dim` closer to their respective tables.

3. **Join Reordering**:
   Since `item` and `store_sales` are directly filtered by `i_item_id`, start with these tables.

4. **Limit Pushdown**:
   Although not always possible in PostgreSQL, conceptualize pushing the limit into the subqueries or closer to the data retrieval stage.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
FROM item
JOIN inventory ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk
JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 58 AND 88
  AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2001-01-13' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2001-01-13' AS DATE) + 60)
  AND i_manufact_id IN (259, 559, 580, 485)
  AND inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
ORDER BY i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

In this optimized query:
- Explicit `JOIN` syntax is used for better readability and potentially more efficient execution plans.
- Conditions are kept close to their relevant tables, which can help in executing filters early.
- The query structure is simplified by using explicit joins, which might help the database optimizer to create a more efficient execution plan.
