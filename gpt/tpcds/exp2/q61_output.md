To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, reduce the amount of data processed, and improve the overall execution plan without changing the semantics of the query. Here are the rules I will apply:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to where the data originates to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundancy within subqueries to avoid repeated calculations or joins.
3. **Projection Pushdown**: Limit the columns retrieved in the subqueries to only those necessary for the final result.
4. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins that do not affect the result.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query calculates the percentage of sales from promotions compared to total sales for a specific category ('Home'), date (December 2000), and stores in a specific GMT offset (-7). It uses two subqueries to calculate the total sales and the sales from promotions separately, then computes the percentage in the outer query.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We push conditions related to `d_year`, `d_moy`, `i_category`, and `ca_gmt_offset` directly into the respective subqueries to reduce the amount of data processed.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Both subqueries filter `store_sales`, `date_dim`, `customer`, `customer_address`, and `item` tables on several common conditions. We can create a common table expression (CTE) for these filtered results and reuse it in both subqueries.

3. **Projection Pushdown**: In the subqueries, only the `ss_ext_sales_price` is needed for the aggregation. Ensure that only necessary columns are fetched in the joins.

4. **Join Elimination**: The `customer` and `customer_address` tables are joined but are only used to ensure the customer's address matches. If not used elsewhere for filtering or output, this join can potentially be eliminated. However, without full schema knowledge, this assumption might be risky, so we'll keep these joins.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH FilteredData AS (
    SELECT ss.ss_ext_sales_price, ss.ss_promo_sk
    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN store s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
    JOIN customer c ON ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    JOIN item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    WHERE ca.ca_gmt_offset = -7
      AND i.i_category = 'Home'
      AND s.s_gmt_offset = -7
      AND d.d_year = 2000
      AND d.d_moy = 12
),
PromotionalSales AS (
    SELECT SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS promotions
    FROM FilteredData
    JOIN promotion p ON FilteredData.ss_promo_sk = p.p_promo_sk
    WHERE p.p_channel_dmail = 'Y' OR p.p_channel_email = 'Y' OR p.p_channel_tv = 'Y'
),
TotalSales AS (
    SELECT SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total
    FROM FilteredData
)
SELECT 
    p.promotions,
    t.total,
    CAST(p.promotions AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(t.total AS DECIMAL(15,4)) * 100 AS promotion_percentage
FROM PromotionalSales p, TotalSales t
ORDER BY p.promotions, t.total
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query reduces redundancy and focuses processing on only the necessary data, potentially improving performance significantly.
