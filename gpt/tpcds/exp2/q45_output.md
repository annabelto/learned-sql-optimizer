To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data processed in the joins and subsequent operations.
2. **Subquery Flattening**: Convert subqueries to joins where possible to enable better optimization by the query planner.
3. **Use of IN-list for Subquery**: Convert the subquery used in the `IN` clause to a list if the list is static and small, which can be more efficient.
4. **Join Order Optimization**: Reorder joins to start with the tables having highly selective filters to reduce the size of intermediate results early in the query processing.
5. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Remove unnecessary columns from the select and join clauses that are not needed for the final output or in subsequent operations.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query joins multiple tables and filters on various conditions, including a subquery within an `IN` clause. The query also uses string functions and checks for specific values in the `date_dim` table.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Push the conditions related to `date_dim` (`d_qoy = 1 and d_year = 2000`) and `item` (`i_item_id` and `i_item_sk`) closer to their respective table scans.

2. **Subquery Flattening**: The subquery in the `IN` clause can be flattened by joining the `item` table directly based on the `i_item_sk` values.

3. **Use of IN-list for Subquery**: Replace the subquery with a direct `IN` list for `i_item_sk`.

4. **Join Order Optimization**: Start the joins with `date_dim` and `item` since they have highly selective filters (`d_qoy`, `d_year`, and `i_item_sk`).

5. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Ensure only necessary columns are used in the select and join operations.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, ca_city, SUM(ws_sales_price)
FROM 
    web_sales
JOIN 
    customer ON ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk AND i_item_sk IN (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2000
WHERE 
    SUBSTR(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
GROUP BY 
    ca_zip, ca_city
ORDER BY 
    ca_zip, ca_city
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query should perform better due to reduced data movement and more efficient use of indexes and joins. The use of direct `IN` lists and the reordering of joins based on selective filters should particularly help in reducing the query execution time.
