To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the `JOIN` clauses or as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data processed by filtering rows earlier in the execution plan.

2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not affect the final result. In this case, we need to check if all joins are necessary based on the selected columns and conditions.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control.

4. **Reduction of Casting Operations**: If possible, reduce the number of times casting is performed, especially within aggregate functions, if the data types are already appropriate.

5. **Limit Pushdown**: If there's a limit clause, ensuring that it is executed as late as possible to avoid carrying unnecessary rows through the query plan.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    ca_country, 
    ca_state, 
    ca_county, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_quantity AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg1, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_list_price AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg2, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_coupon_amt AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg3, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_sales_price AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg4, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_net_profit AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg5, 
    AVG(CAST(c_birth_year AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg6, 
    AVG(CAST(cd1.cd_dep_count AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg7 
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001
JOIN 
    customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk AND c_birth_month IN (1,3,7,11,10,4)
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd1 ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd1.cd_demo_sk AND cd1.cd_gender = 'F' AND cd1.cd_education_status = 'Primary'
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd2 ON c_current_cdemo_sk = cd2.cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk AND ca_state IN ('AL','MO','TN','GA','MT','IN','CA')
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county)
ORDER BY 
    ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Join Conditions Enhanced**: Moved relevant filtering conditions directly into the `JOIN` clauses.
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed from implicit joins to explicit for clarity and better optimization by the query planner.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to ensure that filters such as `d_year = 2001` and `c_birth_month IN (...)` are processed as early as possible.
- **Limit Clause**: Kept at the end after sorting to ensure only the necessary rows are processed for the final output.

This rewritten query should perform better due to more efficient filtering and reduced data movement across the joins.
