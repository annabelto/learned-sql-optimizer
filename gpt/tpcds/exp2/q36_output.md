To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: The `s_state` filter contains multiple identical values. We can simplify this to a single condition.
2. **Simplify Expressions**: The `grouping()` function is used multiple times with the same arguments. We can compute it once and reuse the result.
3. **Use of Aliases for Repeated Expressions**: The expression `sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price)` is used multiple times. We can compute it once in the SELECT clause and then reference it in the ORDER BY clause.
4. **Reduce Scope of Window Function**: The window function `rank()` is computed over potentially large partitions. By simplifying the partitioning expression, we can potentially reduce the computational overhead.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    *,
    gross_margin,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    lochierarchy,
    rank_within_parent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        sum(ss_net_profit) / sum(ss_ext_sales_price) AS gross_margin,
        i_category,
        i_class,
        grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class) AS lochierarchy,
        rank() OVER (
            PARTITION BY lochierarchy,
            CASE WHEN grouping(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END 
            ORDER BY gross_margin ASC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        store_sales,
        date_dim d1,
        item,
        store
    WHERE 
        d1.d_year = 2000 AND 
        d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk AND 
        i_item_sk = ss_item_sk AND 
        s_store_sk = ss_store_sk AND 
        s_state = 'TN'
    GROUP BY 
        ROLLUP(i_category, i_class)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    lochierarchy DESC,
    CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END,
    rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: The `s_state` filter was simplified to `s_state = 'TN'` since all values were the same.
- **Step 2**: The `grouping()` function is computed once per row and reused in the `PARTITION BY` clause of the window function.
- **Step 3**: The expression `sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price)` is calculated once as `gross_margin` and reused in the `ORDER BY` clause.
- **Step 4**: The `PARTITION BY` clause in the window function now uses the `lochierarchy` alias, which simplifies the expression and potentially reduces the number of partitions the database needs to manage.

These optimizations should help in reducing the computational overhead and improving the execution time of the query.
