To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves the predicates closer to the data source. It reduces the amount of data processed by filtering rows earlier in the query execution.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundant sub-expressions to avoid duplicate calculations.

3. **Join Simplification**: This rule simplifies joins by considering the nature of the join and the data involved.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ssci AS (
    SELECT 
        ss_customer_sk AS customer_sk, 
        ss_item_sk AS item_sk 
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1199 AND 1210
    GROUP BY 
        ss_customer_sk, 
        ss_item_sk
), 
csci AS (
    SELECT 
        cs_bill_customer_sk AS customer_sk, 
        cs_item_sk AS item_sk 
    FROM 
        catalog_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1199 AND 1210
    GROUP BY 
        cs_bill_customer_sk, 
        cs_item_sk
)
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN ssci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS store_only,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ssci.customer_sk IS NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS catalog_only,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ssci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS store_and_catalog
FROM 
    ssci
FULL OUTER JOIN 
    csci ON ssci.customer_sk = csci.customer_sk AND ssci.item_sk = csci.item_sk
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the `d_month_seq` filter into the `WHERE` clause of the subqueries for `store_sales` and `catalog_sales`. This ensures that only relevant rows from `date_dim` are joined, reducing the size of the intermediate result set.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Not explicitly shown here, but by structuring the query with CTEs (`ssci` and `csci`), we avoid recalculating the same expressions multiple times.

3. **Join Simplification**: The join conditions and the structure remain the same, but ensuring that the joins are done after filtering reduces the complexity and size of the join operation.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage of the query by minimizing the amount of data being processed and moved around during the query execution.
