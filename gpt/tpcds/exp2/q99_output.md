To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which they will be applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Common Expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate repeated expressions by calculating them once and reusing the result.
3. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to minimize the size of intermediate results, which can reduce the overall query execution time.

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20),
       sm_type,
       cc_name,
       SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
       SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) AND (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
       SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) AND (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
       SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) AND (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",
       SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM catalog_sales,
     warehouse,
     ship_mode,
     call_center,
     date_dim
WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11
  AND cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
  AND cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk
  AND cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
GROUP BY substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, cc_name
ORDER BY substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, cc_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We push the `d_month_seq` filter directly into the join condition with `date_dim` to reduce the number of rows joined.

2. **Common Expression Elimination**: The expression `cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk` is used multiple times. We can compute it once and reuse it.

3. **Join Reordering**: Not much scope in this query as it's already optimized given the filters and joins. However, ensuring smaller dimension tables (`warehouse`, `ship_mode`, `call_center`) are joined earlier could be beneficial if not already optimized by the query planner.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20),
       sm_type,
       cc_name,
       SUM(CASE WHEN days_diff <= 30 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
       SUM(CASE WHEN days_diff > 30 AND days_diff <= 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
       SUM(CASE WHEN days_diff > 60 AND days_diff <= 90 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
       SUM(CASE WHEN days_diff > 90 AND days_diff <= 120 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",
       SUM(CASE WHEN days_diff > 120 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM (
    SELECT cs_ship_date_sk, cs_sold_date_sk, cs_warehouse_sk, cs_ship_mode_sk, cs_call_center_sk,
           w_warehouse_name, sm_type, cc_name,
           cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk AS days_diff
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
    JOIN ship_mode ON cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk
    JOIN call_center ON cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11
) subquery
GROUP BY substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, cc_name
ORDER BY substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, cc_name
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data processing and reuse of computed expressions.
