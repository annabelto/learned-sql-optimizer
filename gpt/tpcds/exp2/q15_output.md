To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. By applying filters early, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to reduce the size of intermediate results. Smaller intermediate results generally lead to faster query execution times.

3. **Use of IN instead of OR for List Comparisons**: When checking for multiple values, using `IN` can sometimes be more efficient than multiple `OR` conditions.

4. **Eliminating Redundant Columns**: Only select columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in joins and conditions.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price)
FROM 
  (SELECT cs_bill_customer_sk, cs_sales_price, cs_sold_date_sk
   FROM catalog_sales
   WHERE cs_sales_price > 500) cs
JOIN 
  (SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
   FROM customer) c ON cs.cs_bill_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN 
  (SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_zip
   FROM customer_address
   WHERE substr(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
      OR ca_state IN ('CA', 'WA', 'GA')) ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
  (SELECT d_date_sk
   FROM date_dim
   WHERE d_qoy = 2 AND d_year = 2001) d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
GROUP BY ca_zip
ORDER BY ca_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

#### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Filters related to `cs_sales_price`, `ca_zip`, `ca_state`, and `date_dim` attributes are pushed down to the respective table subqueries. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be joined.
- **Join Reordering**: The joins are reordered based on the filtered data, which likely reduces the size of the join results early in the query execution.
- **Use of IN instead of OR**: The original query already uses `IN` for zip codes and states, which is typically more efficient than multiple `OR` conditions.
- **Eliminating Redundant Columns**: In the subqueries, only the necessary columns for joins and conditions are selected, reducing the data that needs to be processed and transferred between operations.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage of the query.
