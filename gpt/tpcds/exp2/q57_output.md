To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subquery where they are relevant. This reduces the amount of data processed in the outer queries.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries.
3. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify or reorganize expressions for clarity and potential performance improvement.
4. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if the join keys are guaranteed to have a unique or constant relationship.

### Applying the Rules:

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown:
- Push the condition `d_year = 2001` into the subquery `v1` since it is used in both the final selection and within the subquery logic. This reduces the data set early.

#### 2. Common Sub-expression Elimination:
- The calculation for `d_year = 2001-1` and `d_year = 2001+1` can be simplified directly in the WHERE clause to `d_year = 2000` and `d_year = 2002` respectively.

#### 3. Simplifying Expressions:
- Simplify the CASE expression in the WHERE clause of the final SELECT to improve readability and potentially enhance execution by the query planner.

#### 4. Join Elimination:
- Since the joins in `v2` are based on the `v1` subquery with matching columns and are used to fetch lag and lead values, ensure that these are necessary and cannot be replaced by window functions directly in `v1`.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_brand, 
        cc_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_moy, 
        SUM(cs_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(cs_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year) AS avg_monthly_sales,
        rank() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, cc_name ORDER BY d_year, d_moy) AS rn
    FROM 
        item, 
        catalog_sales, 
        date_dim, 
        call_center
    WHERE 
        cs_item_sk = i_item_sk AND 
        cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND 
        cc_call_center_sk = cs_call_center_sk AND 
        (d_year = 2001 OR d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 12 OR d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 1)
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, 
        i_brand, 
        cc_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_moy
), 
v2 AS (
    SELECT 
        v1.i_category, 
        v1.i_brand, 
        v1.cc_name, 
        v1.d_year, 
        v1.avg_monthly_sales, 
        v1.sum_sales, 
        v1_lag.sum_sales AS psum, 
        v1_lead.sum_sales AS nsum
    FROM 
        v1
    JOIN v1 v1_lag ON v1.i_category = v1_lag.i_category AND v1.i_brand = v1_lag.i_brand AND v1.cc_name = v1_lag.cc_name AND v1.rn = v1_lag.rn + 1
    JOIN v1 v1_lead ON v1.i_category = v1_lead.i_category AND v1.i_brand = v1_lead.i_brand AND v1.cc_name = v1_lead.cc_name AND v1.rn = v1_lead.rn - 1
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    v2
WHERE 
    d_year = 2001 AND 
    avg_monthly_sales > 0 AND 
    ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    avg_monthly_sales
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data processing and clearer logic.
