To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by reusing the results of common sub-expressions.
3. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute additional columns or rows to the result, it can be eliminated.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query has three main parts, each querying a different sales table (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`) but filtering on similar conditions and joining with the same tables (`date_dim`, `customer_address`, `item`). Each subquery filters `item` based on a category and joins with sales data from a specific year and month, and a specific GMT offset.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
We push predicates related to `d_year`, `d_moy`, and `ca_gmt_offset` directly into the subqueries to reduce the amount of data being joined and grouped.

#### Step 2: Common Sub-expression Elimination
The subquery filtering `item` based on category 'Jewelry' is repeated in all three main subqueries. We can compute this once and reuse it.

#### Step 3: Join Elimination
If the joins do not add additional columns used in the final output or filtering, they can be eliminated. However, in this case, all joins contribute to the final result set, so join elimination is not applicable here.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),
ss AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN filtered_items ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 10 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
cs AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON cs_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN filtered_items ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 10 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
ws AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN filtered_items ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 10 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT i_item_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM ss
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM cs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM ws
) tmp1
GROUP BY i_item_id
ORDER BY i_item_id, total_sales
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query reduces redundancy by computing the filtered list of items only once and reuses it across the subqueries. It also applies predicate pushdown to minimize the amount of data processed in each subquery.
