To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates closer to the data source to reduce the amount of data processed and transferred in the query. This is particularly useful in the subqueries for `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales`.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries that are repeated in different parts of the query.

3. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify or reformat expressions to make them more efficient or readable.

4. **Use of Proper Joins**: Ensure that the most efficient type of join is used based on the query's context.

5. **Elimination of Unnecessary Casts**: Remove unnecessary casting if the data types are already compatible.

### Optimized Query

```sql

        SUM(0) AS returns, 
        SUM(0) AS profit_loss 
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_date BETWEEN '2000-08-19'::date AND '2000-08-19'::date + INTERVAL '14 days'
    GROUP BY

        SUM(0) AS returns, 
        SUM(0) AS profit_loss 
    FROM 
        web_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        web_site ON ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
    WHERE 
        d_date BETWEEN '2000-08-19'::date AND '2000-08-19'::date + INTERVAL '14 days'
    GROUP BY 
        web_site_id
)
SELECT 
    channel, 
    id, 
    SUM(sales) AS sales, 
    SUM(returns) AS returns, 
    SUM(profit) AS profit 
FROM (
    SELECT 'store channel' AS channel, 'store' || s_store_id AS id, sales, returns, profit - profit_loss AS profit FROM ssr
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'catalog channel' AS channel, 'catalog_page' || cp_catalog_page_id AS id, sales, returns, profit - profit_loss AS profit FROM csr
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'web channel' AS channel, 'web_site' || web_site_id AS id, sales, returns, profit - profit_loss AS profit FROM wsr
) x 
GROUP BY ROLLUP (channel, id) 
ORDER BY channel, id 
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query reduces the complexity by eliminating unnecessary casts and pushing predicates closer to where the data resides, which should help in improving the performance of the query execution.
