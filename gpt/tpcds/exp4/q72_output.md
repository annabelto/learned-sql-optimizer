To further optimize the query while ensuring that the performance is at least as good as the original, we need to focus on fine-tuning the existing structure without making drastic changes that could potentially degrade performance. Here are some refined optimization strategies:

1. **Efficient Aggregation**: Use more efficient aggregation methods if possible.
2. **Index Optimization**: Ensure that the database has appropriate indexes for the join and where clauses.
3. **Avoid Redundant Data Processing**: Ensure that no unnecessary data processing is done in the joins and where clauses.

Given the constraints and the need to maintain or improve performance, let's refine the query with these considerations:

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_desc,
    w_warehouse_name,
    d1.d_week_seq,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo,
    COUNT(*) AS total_cnt
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    inventory ON cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk
JOIN 
    warehouse ON w_warehouse_sk = inv_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    promotion ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    catalog_returns ON cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND cr_order_number = cs_order_number
WHERE 
    d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq AND
    inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity AND
    d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5 AND
    hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' AND
    d1.d_year = 1998 AND
    cd_marital_status = 'S'
GROUP BY 
    i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq
ORDER BY 
    total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq
LIMIT 100;
```

**Optimization Details:**
- **Maintain Original Structure**: The query structure is maintained as close to the original as possible to ensure no logical changes affect performance.
- **Indexing**: It is crucial to have indexes on `cs_item_sk`, `inv_item_sk`, `w_warehouse_sk`, `cs_bill_cdemo_sk`, `cs_bill_hdemo_sk`, `cs_sold_date_sk`, `inv_date_sk`, `cs_ship_date_sk`, and particularly on the columns involved in the WHERE clause conditions (`d_week_seq`, `inv_quantity_on_hand`, `d_date`, `hd_buy_potential`, `d_year`, `cd_marital_status`).
- **Efficient Aggregation and Filtering**: The aggregation functions and CASE statements are used efficiently, and the filtering conditions are placed to minimize the number of rows processed as early as possible.

This query should perform at least as well as the original while maintaining the logical integrity of the results. The performance should be validated with actual execution plans and further refined based on specific database configurations and data distributions.
