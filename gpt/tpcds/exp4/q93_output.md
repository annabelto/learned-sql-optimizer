To ensure that the optimized query matches the output of the original query while also aiming for improved performance, let's carefully adjust the query structure, focusing on maintaining the logical flow and data integrity of the original query.

### Revisiting the Original Query
The original query calculates the actual sales (`act_sales`) by considering returns, and it filters based on a specific reason description. The goal is to aggregate these sales by customer.

### Key Points for Optimization
1. **Correct Join and Filter Logic**: Ensure that the joins and filters are correctly applied to not alter the result set.
2. **Efficient Filtering**: Apply filters as early as possible in the query process.
3. **Simplify and Optimize Joins**: Optimize the join conditions and ensure that the joins are as efficient as possible.

### Optimized Query
```sql
### Optimized Query
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (
    SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk,
           CASE 
               WHEN sr.sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - sr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price
               ELSE ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price
           END AS act_sales
    FROM store_sales ss
    LEFT JOIN store_returns sr ON ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk AND ss.ss_ticket_number = sr.sr_ticket_number
    LEFT JOIN reason r ON sr.sr_reason_sk = r.r_reason_sk
    WHERE r.r_reason_desc = 'reason 58' OR r.r_reason_desc IS NULL
) AS sales_data
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk
ORDER BY sumsales DESC, ss_customer_sk
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Correct Join and Filter Logic**: The joins are structured to ensure that all sales are considered, and returns are subtracted only when they match the specific reason. The `LEFT JOIN` on `reason` is crucial as it allows for sales records that do not have corresponding returns.
- **Efficient Filtering**: The filter on `r_reason_desc = 'reason 58'` is included in the WHERE clause of the subquery. The condition `OR r.r_reason_desc IS NULL` ensures that sales without corresponding returns are not excluded.
- **Simplify and Optimize Joins**: The join conditions are optimized to ensure that unnecessary data isn't processed. The use of `LEFT JOIN` is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data, ensuring that all sales are considered, even those without corresponding returns.

This approach should maintain the integrity of the original query's results while potentially improving performance through more effective use of joins and filters.
