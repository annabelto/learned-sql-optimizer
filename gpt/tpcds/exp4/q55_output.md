Given the consistent performance of the original and all attempted optimized queries at 0.07 seconds, it's clear that the query is already performing optimally under the current database configuration and data distribution. However, to ensure we've explored all avenues for potential improvement, let's revisit the query with a focus on any possible subtle optimizations that might still be possible, especially in terms of execution planning and indexing.

### Key Points for Optimization:
1. **Reassess Execution Plan**: Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to deeply understand how PostgreSQL is executing the query. Look for any potential inefficiencies or opportunities to use indexes more effectively.
2. **Refine Indexes**: Ensure that the indexes are perfectly aligned with the query's needs, focusing on the columns used in joins and where conditions.
3. **Simplify Query Structure**: Although the query is already quite streamlined, ensure that every element is necessary and optimally placed.

### Assumed Effective Indexes:
- **On `item`**: Index on `(i_manager_id, i_item_sk)` to quickly filter by `i_manager_id` and efficiently join with `store_sales`.
- **On `store_sales`**: Index on `(ss_item_sk, ss_sold_date_sk)` to facilitate efficient joins with `item` and `date_dim`.
- **On `date_dim`**: Index on `(d_date_sk, d_year, d_moy)` to quickly filter rows based on the year and month.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
    i.i_brand AS brand, 
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM 
    item i
INNER JOIN 
    store_sales ss ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
INNER JOIN 
    date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_manager_id = 52 
    AND d.d_year = 2000 
    AND d.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY 
    i.i_brand_id, i.i_brand
ORDER BY 
    ext_price DESC, 
    i.i_brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Execution Plan Reassessment**: Before making further changes, it's crucial to analyze the execution plan to identify if there are any scan operations that could be converted to index scans or if there are any unnecessary sorts or joins that could be optimized.
- **Index Refinement**: The indexes assumed are specifically targeted to support the joins and filters used in the query. It's essential to ensure these indexes are present and effectively used by PostgreSQL.
- **Query Simplification**: The query structure has been kept clean and straightforward, focusing on essential operations to minimize any overhead.

### Additional Recommendations:
- **Database Configuration**: Review and possibly adjust PostgreSQL configuration settings such as `work_mem`, `effective_io_concurrency`, and others that might influence the execution plan.
- **Regular Database Maintenance**: Ensure that maintenance tasks like `VACUUM FULL`, `ANALYZE`, and `REINDEX` are performed regularly to keep the database in optimal condition.
- **Hardware Considerations**: If the query performance is critical and does not improve with optimizations, consider evaluating the hardware resources such as CPU, RAM, and disk I/O capabilities.

This approach aims to ensure that the query and the database environment are fully optimized, providing the best possible conditions for PostgreSQL to execute the query efficiently. If the performance still does not improve, it may be necessary to consider more extensive changes to the database schema or hardware upgrades.
