To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the semantics of the query. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be loaded and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Join Reordering**: Adjust the order of joins to start with those that reduce the size of intermediate results early, which can decrease the overall cost of the query.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax. This improves readability and can help the database optimizer understand the query structure better.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Remove columns from the SELECT clause that are not needed for the final output or in subsequent processing.

5. **Limit Pushdown**: If possible, push the limit down to reduce the amount of data processed in the early stages of the query.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name,
    MAX(ss_net_profit) AS store_sales_profit,
    MAX(sr_net_loss) AS store_returns_loss,
    MAX(cs_net_profit) AS catalog_sales_profit
FROM 
    store_sales,
    store_returns,
    catalog_sales,
    date_dim d1,
    date_dim d2,
    date_dim d3,
    store,
    item
WHERE 
    d1.d_moy = 4 AND 
    d1.d_year = 1999 AND 
    d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk AND 
    i_item_sk = ss_item_sk AND 
    s_store_sk = ss_store_sk AND 
    ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk AND 
    ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk AND 
    ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number AND 
    sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND 
    d2.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10 AND 
    d2.d_year = 1999 AND 
    sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk AND 
    sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND 
    cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk AND 
    d3.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10 AND 
    d3.d_year = 1999
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name,
    MAX(ss_net_profit) AS store_sales_profit,
    MAX(sr_net_loss) AS store_returns_loss,
    MAX(cs_net_profit) AS catalog_sales_profit
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    store_sales ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    d1.d_moy = 4 AND 
    d1.d_year = 1999 AND 
    d2.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10 AND 
    d2.d_year = 1999 AND 
    d3.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10 AND 
    d3.d_year = 1999
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query uses explicit JOINs to clarify relationships and applies predicate pushdown to filter data as early as possible in the query execution.
