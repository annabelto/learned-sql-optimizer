I apologize for the previous misunderstandings. Let's ensure that the optimized query maintains the exact logical equivalence with the original query while attempting to improve performance. We will focus on optimizing the subquery execution and ensuring efficient use of indexes.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
WHERE i_manufact_id = 722
AND d_date BETWEEN '2001-03-09' AND ('2001-03-09'::date + 90)
AND cs_ext_discount_amt > (
    SELECT 1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt)
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2001-03-09' AND ('2001-03-09'::date + 90)
    AND cs_item_sk = catalog_sales.cs_item_sk
)
LIMIT 100;
```

#### Adjustments and Explanation:
- **Correlated Subquery**: The subquery is now correctly correlated with the outer query by matching `cs_item_sk` from both `catalog_sales` in the outer query and the subquery. This ensures that the average discount amount is calculated per item, as required by the original query logic.
- **Efficient Join Conditions**: The main query joins with the `item` and `date_dim` tables based on their respective keys, ensuring that only relevant data is processed.
- **Index Utilization**: It is crucial to have appropriate indexes on:
   - `catalog_sales(cs_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk, cs_ext_discount_amt)`
   - `item(i_item_sk, i_manufact_id)`
   - `date_dim(d_date_sk, d_date)`
   These indexes will help in quickly filtering data based on the join conditions and the `WHERE` clause predicates.
- **Limit and Aggregate**: The `LIMIT 100` is applied after the aggregation to ensure that only the necessary amount of data is processed and returned.

This version should maintain the logical equivalence of the original query while potentially offering better performance through proper correlation and indexing. The use of a correlated subquery ensures that the average discount is calculated per item, matching the original query's logic.
