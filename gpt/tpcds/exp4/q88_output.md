To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. The query involves multiple subqueries that are structurally similar, differing only in the time conditions and the count aggregation. Here are the steps and rules used for optimization:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates as close as possible to the data source. By applying this rule, we ensure that filters on `time_dim`, `household_demographics`, and `store` are applied early in each subquery, reducing the size of intermediate results.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Since the conditions on `household_demographics` and `store` are repeated across all subqueries, we can create a common table expression (CTE) that pre-filters `store_sales`, `household_demographics`, and `store` based on these repeated conditions. This CTE can then be joined with `time_dim` in each specific time condition.

3. **Simplification of Expressions**: The expressions for vehicle count checks are simplified by directly using constants instead of expressions like `0+2`, `-1+2`, etc.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH filtered_sales AS (
    SELECT ss_sold_time_sk, ss_store_sk
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
    WHERE store.s_store_name = 'ese'
      AND (
          (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 0 AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count <= 2) OR
          (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = -1 AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count <= 1) OR
          (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 3 AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count <= 5)
      )
),
time_filtered AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t_hour = 8 AND t_minute >= 30) AS h8_30_to_9,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t_hour = 9 AND t_minute < 30) AS h9_to_9_30,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t_hour = 9 AND t_minute >= 30) AS h9_30_to_10,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t_hour = 10 AND t_minute < 30) AS h10_to_10_30,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t_hour = 10 AND t_minute >= 30) AS h10_30_to_11,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t_hour = 11 AND t_minute < 30) AS h11_to_11_30,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t_hour = 11 AND t_minute >= 30) AS h11_30_to_12,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t_hour = 12 AND t_minute < 30) AS h12_to_12_30
    FROM time_dim
    JOIN filtered_sales ON time_dim.t_time_sk = filtered_sales.ss_sold_time_sk
)
SELECT * FROM time_filtered;
```

This optimized query reduces redundancy by using a CTE to handle common filtering and applies conditional aggregation to handle different time slots in a single scan of the `time_dim` table, significantly improving performance.
