To further optimize the query, we need to consider additional strategies that might help in reducing the execution time beyond the initial rewrite. Here are some additional optimizations that can be considered:

1. **Index Utilization**: Ensure that indexes are available on the columns used in JOINs, WHERE clauses, and ORDER BY clauses. This can significantly speed up these operations.
2. **Materialized Views**: If the query is run frequently with similar parameters, consider using materialized views for parts of the query that do not change often.
3. **Query Refactoring**: Further simplify the query by analyzing the execution plan to identify any bottlenecks or suboptimal operations.

### Further Analysis
Given that the previous optimizations did not yield a performance improvement, we should check the execution plan to identify slow parts of the query. However, without access to the actual database and its statistics, we can make some educated guesses to further optimize the query.

### Additional Optimizations Applied

1. **Index Suggestions**: Ensure that indexes exist on:
   - `store_sales(ss_sold_date_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_hdemo_sk, ss_addr_sk, ss_customer_sk)`
   - `date_dim(d_date_sk, d_dow, d_year)`
   - `store(s_store_sk, s_city)`
   - `household_demographics(hd_demo_sk, hd_dep_count, hd_vehicle_count)`
   - `customer_address(ca_address_sk, ca_city)`
   - `customer(c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk)`

2. **Avoid Redundant GROUP BY**: The original query might be grouping by `ss_addr_sk` unnecessarily since it's not used elsewhere in the select or outer query.

3. **Limit Pushdown**: If the database engine supports it, pushing the limit into the subquery might help if the outer query filters do not significantly reduce the result set.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    ca_city,
    bought_city,
    ss_ticket_number,
    amt,
    profit
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        ca_city AS bought_city,
        SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
    JOIN household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON store_sales.ss_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 8 OR household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count = 0)
        AND date_dim.d_dow IN (6, 0)
        AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
        AND store.s_city IN ('Midway', 'Fairview')
    GROUP BY 
        ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, ca_city
) dn
JOIN customer ON dn.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address current_addr ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = current_addr.ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    current_addr.ca_city <> bought_city
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name, c_first_name, ca_city, bought_city, ss_ticket_number
LIMIT 100;
```

This version of the query assumes that appropriate indexes are in place, which is crucial for performance improvement. Additionally, the removal of unnecessary GROUP BY fields and ensuring that the LIMIT is effectively used can also help in certain database configurations.
