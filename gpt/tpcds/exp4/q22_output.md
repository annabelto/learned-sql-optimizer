To further optimize the query and attempt to achieve better performance than the original, we can consider additional strategies such as:

1. **Indexing**: Ensure that there are appropriate indexes on the join and filter columns. This can significantly speed up the join operations and the filtering process.

2. **Materialized Views**: If the data in the `date_dim` table or the results of certain joins are relatively static, using a materialized view to pre-compute and store the result can reduce the computation time during query execution.

3. **Columnar Storage**: If using PostgreSQL extensions like cstore_fdw (columnar store for analytics), converting the storage format for large tables involved in analytical queries can improve performance.

4. **Cost-based Join Reordering**: Depending on the PostgreSQL version and available statistics, the planner might not always choose the optimal join order. Forcing a specific join order might help, but it requires understanding the data distribution and size.

5. **Parallel Query Execution**: Ensure that PostgreSQL is configured to use parallel query processing if supported and beneficial for the workload.

### Revisiting the Query Optimization:

Given that the previous optimization did not yield the expected results, let's consider indexing and review the join conditions and grouping again.

### Assumed Indexes:
- An index on `date_dim(d_date_sk, d_month_seq)` to speed up filtering and joining on `date_dim`.
- An index on `inventory(inv_item_sk, inv_date_sk)` to speed up the join between `inventory` and `item`, and `inventory` and `date_dim`.
- An index on `item(i_item_sk)` to speed up the join between `item` and `inventory`.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category, AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM item
JOIN inventory ON inventory.inv_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON date_dim.d_date_sk = inventory.inv_date_sk
WHERE date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211
GROUP BY ROLLUP(i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category)
ORDER BY qoh, i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the database statistics are up to date (`ANALYZE` command) so that the query planner can make informed decisions.
- Consider adjusting the `work_mem` parameter if the sort/group by operations are spilling to disk.
- Review the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output of the query to identify any unexpected bottlenecks or scan methods.

This revised query assumes that the indexes are properly set up and that the PostgreSQL configuration is tuned for the workload. If performance issues persist, further investigation into the execution plan and system configuration would be necessary.
