To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the amount of data processed and improve the execution plan. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates (filter conditions) closer to the data sources. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be loaded and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute additional columns or rows required for the final result, it can be eliminated. This reduces the complexity and cost of the query.

3. **Use of IN instead of OR for Filters**: This can sometimes simplify the execution plan and make better use of indexes.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    AVG(ss_quantity) AS agg1, 
    AVG(ss_list_price) AS agg2, 
    AVG(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, 
    AVG(ss_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cd_gender = 'F' AND cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
JOIN 
    promotion ON ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id 
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: I moved the conditions related to `date_dim`, `customer_demographics`, and `promotion` directly into the respective JOIN conditions. This ensures that filtering happens as early as possible, reducing the amount of data that flows through the joins.

2. **Join Elimination**: In this specific query, all joins seem necessary because they either contribute to the WHERE clause or are needed for the final SELECT list. Therefore, no joins were eliminated.

3. **Use of IN instead of OR for Filters**: The original query uses OR conditions for the `promotion` table. However, since the conditions are simple and there are only two, converting them to use IN does not provide a significant benefit and might not improve readability or performance. Thus, I kept the original OR conditions.

By applying these optimizations, the query should execute more efficiently while maintaining the same output.
