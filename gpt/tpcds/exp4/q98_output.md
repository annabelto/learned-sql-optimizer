To ensure that the optimized query matches the output of the original query while attempting to improve performance, I will revise the approach, focusing on maintaining the exact logical flow and data integrity of the original query. Let's refine the optimization strategy while ensuring that the output remains consistent.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ss_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    store_sales,
    item,
    date_dim
WHERE 
    ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
    AND i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Jewelry')
    AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
    AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-02-05' AS DATE) AND (CAST('1999-02-05' AS DATE) + 30)
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio;
```

### Optimization Strategy:
1. **Maintain Logical Integrity**: Ensure that the joins and filters are correctly applied as in the original query.
2. **Efficient Date Handling**: Precompute the date range to avoid repeated casting and computation.
3. **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Use explicit JOINs for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH DateRange AS (
    SELECT 
        d_date_sk
    FROM 
        date_dim
    WHERE 
        d_date BETWEEN '1999-02-05'::date AND '1999-03-07'::date  -- Precomputed end date
)
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ss_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    DateRange ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Jewelry')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio;
```

In this revised optimized query:
- A CTE (`DateRange`) is used to precompute the date range, reducing the overhead of repeated date calculations in the main query.
- Explicit JOIN syntax is used to clearly define relationships between tables.
- The WHERE clause and GROUP BY remain consistent with the original query to ensure the output matches exactly.

This approach should maintain the output integrity while potentially improving the performance by optimizing date handling and clarifying the join structure.
