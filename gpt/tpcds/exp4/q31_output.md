To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which they will be applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter conditions as close as possible to the data source in the subqueries. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by reusing the results of common expressions computed more than once within the query.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated to reduce complexity.

4. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify complex expressions where possible, to reduce computation overhead.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ss AS (
    SELECT 
        ca_county,
        d_qoy,
        d_year,
        SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS store_sales
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 1999 AND d_qoy IN (1, 2, 3)
    GROUP BY 
        ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
), 
ws AS (
    SELECT 
        ca_county,
        d_qoy,
        d_year,
        SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS web_sales
    FROM 
        web_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 1999 AND d_qoy IN (1, 2, 3)
    GROUP BY 
        ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
)
SELECT 
    ss1.ca_county,
    ss1.d_year,
    ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales AS web_q1_q2_increase,
    ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales AS store_q1_q2_increase,
    ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales AS web_q2_q3_increase,
    ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales AS store_q2_q3_increase
FROM 
    ss ss1
    JOIN ss ss2 ON ss1.ca_county = ss2.ca_county AND ss2.d_qoy = 2
    JOIN ss ss3 ON ss2.ca_county = ss3.ca_county AND ss3.d_qoy = 3
    JOIN ws ws1 ON ss1.ca_county = ws1.ca_county AND ws1.d_qoy = 1
    JOIN ws ws2 ON ws1.ca_county = ws2.ca_county AND ws2.d_qoy = 2
    JOIN ws ws3 ON ws2.ca_county = ws3.ca_county AND ws3.d_qoy = 3
WHERE 
    ss1.d_qoy = 1
    AND (ws1.web_sales > 0 AND ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales > ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales)
    AND (ws2.web_sales > 0 AND ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales > ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales)
ORDER BY 
    store_q2_q3_increase;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the year and quarter filters into the subqueries for `ss` and `ws`.
- **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Not explicitly shown but ensured that each subquery is computed once and reused.
- **Join Elimination**: Not applicable as all joins contribute to the result.
- **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplified the CASE statements by directly using conditions in the WHERE clause, assuming that sales values are non-negative (common in business contexts). This avoids unnecessary CASE computations.
