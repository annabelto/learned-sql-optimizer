To ensure the optimized query maintains the same output as the original while improving performance, let's focus on optimizing the query without altering its logical structure or output. We'll refine the approach to ensure that the optimizations are effective and maintain the integrity of the original query's results.

### Revised Optimization Strategy:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Continue to push the `d_month_seq` condition into each subquery to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution.

2. **Efficient Joins**: Ensure that joins are performed in a manner that reduces the size of intermediate datasets as early as possible.

3. **Indexing**: If not already present, suggest indexes that could be beneficial for the join and filter operations.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
-- Assuming appropriate indexes are present on the join and filter columns

-- Optimized query using predicate pushdown and efficient joins
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    (SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
     FROM store_sales
     JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk AND date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1202 AND 1213
     JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk)
    EXCEPT
    (SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
     FROM catalog_sales
     JOIN date_dim ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk AND date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1202 AND 1213
     JOIN customer ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk)
    EXCEPT
    (SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
     FROM web_sales
     JOIN date_dim ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk AND date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1202 AND 1213
     JOIN customer ON web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk)
) AS cool_cust;
```

### Explanation:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: The `d_month_seq` condition is pushed directly into the join condition with `date_dim` in each subquery. This reduces the number of rows from `date_dim` that need to be joined with `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales`.

- **Efficient Joins**: By joining `date_dim` directly with the sales tables on both the date key and the month sequence filter, we minimize the size of the result set early in the query execution.

- **Indexing**: It is recommended to have indexes on `ss_sold_date_sk`, `cs_sold_date_sk`, `ws_sold_date_sk` in the sales tables and `d_date_sk`, `d_month_seq` in the `date_dim` table. These indexes will significantly speed up the join operations and the filtering by month sequence.

This approach should maintain the exact logical output of the original query while incorporating optimizations that reduce the amount of data processed and improve the efficiency of joins.
