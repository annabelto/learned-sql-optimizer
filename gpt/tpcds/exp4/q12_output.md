To achieve a performance improvement over the original query, we need to focus on refining the query execution strategy, potentially leveraging more advanced PostgreSQL features or optimizing the existing operations further. Given the previous attempts, let's explore a different approach that might help in reducing the execution time.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_category, i_class, i_current_price,
       SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
       SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ws_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM web_sales
JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE i_category IN ('Men', 'Books', 'Electronics')
  AND d_date BETWEEN DATE '2001-06-15' AND DATE '2001-07-15'
GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_category, i_class, i_current_price
ORDER BY i_category, i_class, i_item_id, i_item_desc, revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Changes and Rationale:
1. **Simplified Date Literals**: Changed the date casting to a more straightforward `DATE` literal, which might help in some cases to simplify the query parsing and execution.

2. **Optimized WHERE Clause**: The `WHERE` clause conditions are kept simple and direct to ensure that PostgreSQL can effectively use indexes on the `date_dim` and `item` tables.

3. **Index Recommendations**: If not already present, ensure that there are indexes on:
   - `item(i_item_sk, i_category)`
   - `date_dim(d_date_sk, d_date)`
   - `web_sales(ws_item_sk, ws_sold_date_sk)`

   These indexes are crucial for performance as they support the join conditions and the filtering based on date and category.

4. **Review Execution Plan**: It is crucial to review the execution plan using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to verify that the query is using the expected indexes and to check if there are any unexpected scans or sorts that could be optimized.

5. **Hardware and Configuration Review**: If the query still does not perform as expected, it might be useful to review PostgreSQL's configuration settings such as `work_mem`, `shared_buffers`, and others that affect performance. Additionally, ensuring that the hardware resources are adequate (e.g., sufficient RAM and fast disk storage) can also be crucial.

This approach aims to refine the query by simplifying some parts and ensuring that it is structured in a way that leverages PostgreSQL's strengths in query execution. If performance issues persist, further detailed analysis of the execution plan and system configuration might be necessary.
