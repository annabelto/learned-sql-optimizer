I apologize for the oversight. Let's ensure that the optimized query maintains the same logical structure as the original query while attempting to improve its performance. We'll focus on maintaining the integrity of the original query's output.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT dt.d_year,
       item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
       item.i_brand AS brand,
       SUM(ss.ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg
FROM date_dim dt
JOIN store_sales ss ON dt.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN item ON ss.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
WHERE item.i_manufact_id = 816 AND dt.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY dt.d_year, item.i_brand_id, item.i_brand
ORDER BY dt.d_year, sum_agg DESC, brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of the Optimized Query:
1. **Maintaining Logical Structure**: The query structure is kept similar to the original to ensure that the output matches exactly. The joins and conditions are preserved as in the original query.

2. **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query uses explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and to ensure that the database engine optimally processes joins.

3. **Index Recommendations**: To ensure the query performs optimally, consider verifying or adding indexes on:
   - `date_dim(d_date_sk, d_moy)`
   - `store_sales(ss_sold_date_sk, ss_item_sk)`
   - `item(i_item_sk, i_manufact_id)`

   These indexes help in speeding up the join operations and the filtering process based on the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: After implementing the query, it's advisable to monitor its performance using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. This will provide insights into how PostgreSQL is executing the query and whether it is using the indexes effectively.

This version of the query aims to optimize performance while ensuring that the output remains consistent with the original query. The use of appropriate indexes and maintaining the structure should help in achieving better performance.
