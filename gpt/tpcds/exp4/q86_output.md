To further optimize the query, we need to focus on improving the efficiency of the joins and the aggregation operations. Here are some additional optimization strategies:

1. **Index Utilization**: Ensure that indexes are used effectively, particularly on the join and filter columns. If not already present, consider adding indexes on `d_date_sk`, `ws_sold_date_sk`, `i_item_sk`, and `ws_item_sk`.

2. **Materialized Views**: If the query is run frequently with the same or similar parameters, consider using a materialized view to precompute and store the result of expensive aggregation and join operations.

3. **Partitioning**: If the tables are very large, consider partitioning them, especially based on columns used in filtering such as `d_month_seq`.

4. **Avoiding Functions in the WHERE Clause**: Functions in the WHERE clause can prevent the use of indexes. Ensure that any function used does not hinder the use of indexes.

5. **Statistics Update**: Ensure that statistics are up to date for all involved tables to help the optimizer choose the best execution plan.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    sub.total_sum,
    sub.i_category,
    sub.i_class,
    sub.lochierarchy,
    sub.rank_within_parent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ws.ws_net_paid) AS total_sum,
        i.i_category,
        i.i_class,
        GROUPING(i.i_category) + GROUPING(i.i_class) AS lochierarchy,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY GROUPING(i.i_category) + GROUPING(i.i_class), 
            CASE WHEN GROUPING(i.i_class) = 0 THEN i.i_category END 
            ORDER BY SUM(ws.ws_net_paid) DESC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        web_sales ws
    INNER JOIN 
        date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ws.ws_sold_date_sk
    INNER JOIN 
        item i ON i.i_item_sk = ws.ws_item_sk
    WHERE 
        d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1186 AND 1197
    GROUP BY 
        ROLLUP(i.i_category, i.i_class)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    sub.lochierarchy DESC, 
    CASE WHEN sub.lochierarchy = 0 THEN sub.i_category END, 
    sub.rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Additional Notes:
- **Indexes**: Ensure indexes on `date_dim.d_date_sk`, `web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk`, `item.i_item_sk`, and `web_sales.ws_item_sk`.
- **Materialized Views**: If the query is a common part of your workload, consider materializing the result of the subquery.
- **Partitioning**: If `web_sales` and `date_dim` are large, partitioning them on columns like `ws_sold_date_sk` and `d_month_seq` might help.
- **Statistics**: Regularly update statistics on the tables involved to ensure the optimizer has the latest data distribution information.

These optimizations aim to leverage database features to reduce the workload and improve the query execution time.
