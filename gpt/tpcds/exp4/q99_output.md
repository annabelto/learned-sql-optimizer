To further optimize the query, we need to reconsider the strategies and ensure that the transformations applied are indeed beneficial. Given that the previous optimizations did not yield a performance improvement, we will focus on other aspects such as indexing, more efficient joins, and ensuring that operations are as close to the data source as possible.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    substr(w.w_warehouse_name, 1, 20) AS warehouse_name_short,
    sm.sm_type,
    cc.cc_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN date_diff <= 30 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN date_diff > 30 AND date_diff <= 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN date_diff > 60 AND date_diff <= 90 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN date_diff > 90 AND date_diff <= 120 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN date_diff > 120 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM 
    catalog_sales cs
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON cs.cs_ship_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    warehouse w ON cs.cs_warehouse_sk = w.w_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    ship_mode sm ON cs.cs_ship_mode_sk = sm.sm_ship_mode_sk
JOIN 
    call_center cc ON cs.cs_call_center_sk = cc.cc_call_center_sk
CROSS JOIN 
    LATERAL (SELECT cs.cs_ship_date_sk - cs.cs_sold_date_sk AS date_diff) AS diff
WHERE 
    d.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1205
GROUP BY 
    substr(w.w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm.sm_type,
    cc.cc_name
ORDER BY 
    substr(w.w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm.sm_type,
    cc.cc_name
LIMIT 100;
```

**Key Changes and Optimizations:**

1. **Explicit Joins**: Changed implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` clauses, which can help the query planner optimize the join order and execution plan more effectively.

2. **Lateral Join for Calculation**: Used a `LATERAL` join for calculating the difference between `cs_ship_date_sk` and `cs_sold_date_sk`. This ensures the calculation is done once per row and can be efficiently used in the `CASE` statements.

3. **Indexing Strategy**: Ensure that there are appropriate indexes on the join columns (`cs_ship_date_sk`, `cs_warehouse_sk`, `cs_ship_mode_sk`, `cs_call_center_sk`, and `d_date_sk`). Also, consider indexing `d_month_seq` if not already indexed, as it is used in a filter.

4. **Filter Placement**: The filter on `d_month_seq` is placed immediately in the `WHERE` clause to reduce the number of rows early in the query processing.

These changes aim to streamline the execution by using explicit joins, which can be more efficiently optimized by the PostgreSQL query planner, and by reducing the overhead of repeated calculations through the use of a lateral join. Additionally, ensuring proper indexing can significantly impact performance.
