To ensure the optimized query matches the output of the original query while maintaining the integrity of the results, let's carefully review and optimize the original query without altering its fundamental logic or results.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH item_filter AS (
    SELECT i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_color IN ('powder', 'orchid', 'pink')
),
ss AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item ON item.i_item_sk = store_sales.ss_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 3 AND ca_gmt_offset = -6
      AND item.i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item_filter)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
cs AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON cs_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item ON item.i_item_sk = catalog_sales.cs_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 3 AND ca_gmt_offset = -6
      AND item.i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item_filter)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
ws AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item ON item.i_item_sk = web_sales.ws_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 3 AND ca_gmt_offset = -6
      AND item.i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item_filter)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT i_item_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM ss
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM cs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM ws
) AS combined_sales
GROUP BY i_item_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

**Key Optimizations and Corrections:**
1. **Filtered Items CTE (item_filter)**: This CTE is used to pre-select `i_item_id` based on the color criteria. This CTE is then used to filter items in the main queries for store, catalog, and web sales.
2. **Join and Filter**: Each sales table (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`) is joined with the `item` table on `i_item_sk`, and then filtered by `i_item_id` that exists in the `item_filter`. This ensures that only relevant items are processed.
3. **Aggregation and Union All**: The use of `UNION ALL` ensures that all records from store, catalog, and web sales are included without eliminating duplicates, which is crucial for correct aggregation in the final select.
4. **Final Aggregation and Sorting**: The final SELECT statement aggregates total sales by `i_item_id` and sorts the results by `total_sales` in descending order, followed by `i_item_id`, which matches the original query's intent.

This optimized query should now correctly reflect the logic of the original query while improving performance through more efficient data handling and reduced redundancy.
