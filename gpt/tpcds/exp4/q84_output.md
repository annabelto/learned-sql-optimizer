To achieve a better optimization of the provided query, we need to focus on the most impactful areas such as ensuring optimal join sequences, leveraging indexing effectively, and minimizing the data processed at each step. Given the previous attempts did not yield improvements, we will refine our approach with a focus on execution efficiency and data processing reduction.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    c.c_customer_id AS customer_id,
    COALESCE(c.c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c.c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM 
    customer c
INNER JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
INNER JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd ON c.c_current_cdemo_sk = cd.cd_demo_sk
INNER JOIN 
    household_demographics hd ON c.c_current_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
INNER JOIN 
    income_band ib ON hd.hd_income_band_sk = ib.ib_income_band_sk
INNER JOIN 
    store_returns sr ON cd.cd_demo_sk = sr.sr_cdemo_sk
WHERE 
    ca.ca_city = 'Woodland'
    AND ib.ib_lower_bound >= 60306
    AND ib.ib_upper_bound <= 60306 + 50000
ORDER BY 
    c.c_customer_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Optimizations Applied:

1. **Efficient Join Ordering**: The joins are ordered based on the likelihood of reducing the result set size early. The `customer_address` table is joined early to quickly limit rows based on the `ca_city` filter.

2. **Filter Placement**: Filters are placed in the `WHERE` clause to ensure they are applied after the joins have been made, which can be more efficient depending on the database's query optimizer and the data distribution.

3. **Indexing Strategy**: Ensure that the following columns are indexed, as they are critical for join conditions and filtering:
   - `customer.c_current_addr_sk`
   - `customer_address.ca_address_sk` and `customer_address.ca_city`
   - `customer.c_current_cdemo_sk`
   - `customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk`
   - `customer.c_current_hdemo_sk`
   - `household_demographics.hd_demo_sk`
   - `household_demographics.hd_income_band_sk`
   - `income_band.ib_income_band_sk`, `income_band.ib_lower_bound`, and `income_band.ib_upper_bound`
   - `customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk`
   - `store_returns.sr_cdemo_sk`

4. **Execution Plan Review**: After applying these changes, it's crucial to review the execution plan to identify if the database is using the indexes effectively and if there are any other unexpected bottlenecks.

5. **Simplification and Clarity**: The query maintains a clear structure, with each join and filter logically placed to enhance readability and potentially improve execution efficiency.

By applying these refinements, the query should ideally perform better than the original, leveraging both structural optimizations and database indexing more effectively. If performance does not improve, it may be necessary to review the physical database design, such as the indexing strategy or the hardware resources available.
