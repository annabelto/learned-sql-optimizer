To ensure the output of the optimized query matches the original, I will revise the approach while maintaining the optimization principles. The original query calculates counts and averages for specific quantity ranges and uses these values in conditional logic. The optimization will focus on reducing the number of subquery executions by precomputing necessary values in a single pass.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
WITH store_sales_summary AS (
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN '1-20'
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN '21-40'
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN '41-60'
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN '61-80'
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN '81-100'
        END AS quantity_range,
        COUNT(*) AS total_count,
        AVG(ss_ext_tax) AS avg_ext_tax,
        AVG(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) AS avg_net_paid_inc_tax
    FROM store_sales
    WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 100
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '1-20' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 1071 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket1,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '21-40' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 39161 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket2,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '41-60' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 29434 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket3,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '61-80' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 6568 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket4,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '81-100' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 21216 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket5
FROM store_sales_summary
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM reason WHERE r_reason_sk = 1);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)**: The `store_sales_summary` CTE computes the count, average extended tax, and average net paid including tax for each quantity range in a single scan of the `store_sales` table. This reduces the number of times the database needs to scan the `store_sales` table from ten times (in the original query) to just once.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**: The filter `ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 100` is applied directly in the CTE, reducing the number of rows processed in the aggregation.

3. **Subquery Flattening**: The `EXISTS` subquery is used to ensure that the output is produced only if there is at least one row in the `reason` table with `r_reason_sk = 1`. This avoids joining with the `reason` table directly, which could be beneficial if the `reason` table is large.

This optimized query should produce the same results as the original query while potentially offering better performance by reducing redundant computations and minimizing the number of table scans.
