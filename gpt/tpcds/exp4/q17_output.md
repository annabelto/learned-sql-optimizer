To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the performance without altering the result set. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates closer to the data sources. This reduces the amount of data processed by filtering rows earlier in the execution plan.
2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not contribute to the final result.
3. **Column Pruning**: Select only the necessary columns in the subqueries to reduce the amount of data being processed and transferred.
4. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries.
5. **Using Indexes**: Ensure that the query uses indexes effectively, especially for filtering and joining large tables.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_state,
    COUNT(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantitycount,
    AVG(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantityave,
    STDDEV_SAMP(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantitystdev,
    STDDEV_SAMP(ss_quantity) / AVG(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantitycov,
    COUNT(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantitycount,
    AVG(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantityave,
    STDDEV_SAMP(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantitystdev,
    STDDEV_SAMP(sr_return_quantity) / AVG(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantitycov,
    COUNT(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantitycount,
    AVG(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantityave,
    STDDEV_SAMP(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantitystdev,
    STDDEV_SAMP(cs_quantity) / AVG(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantitycov
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
WHERE 
    d1.d_quarter_name = '2001Q1'
    AND d2.d_quarter_name IN ('2001Q1', '2001Q2', '2001Q3')
    AND d3.d_quarter_name IN ('2001Q1', '2001Q2', '2001Q3')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_state
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_state
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Optimizations:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to move the filtering conditions on `d_quarter_name` closer to the respective date dimension tables (`d1`, `d2`, `d3`).
- **Join Elimination**: Not applied as all joins seem necessary for the final result.
- **Column Pruning**: Not explicitly shown, but assumed that only necessary columns are fetched from each table.
- **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Not explicitly needed as there are no redundant subexpressions identified.
- **Using Indexes**: Assumed that indexes on `d_date_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, `sr_returned_date_sk`, `cs_sold_date_sk`, `ss_customer_sk`, `ss_item_sk`, `ss_ticket_number`, `sr_customer_sk`, `sr_item_sk`, `cs_bill_customer_sk`, and `cs_item_sk` would be beneficial.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data processing and effective use of indexes.
