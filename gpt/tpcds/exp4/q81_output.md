Apologies for the oversight in the previous query. Let's correct the join condition and ensure the query is optimized correctly. Here's the revised version:

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
    SELECT 
        cr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
        ca_state AS ctr_state,
        SUM(cr_return_amt_inc_tax) AS ctr_total_return
    FROM 
        catalog_returns
        JOIN date_dim ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON cr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001
    GROUP BY 
        cr_returning_customer_sk, ca_state
), avg_returns AS (
    SELECT 
        ctr_state,
        AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_state_return
    FROM 
        customer_total_return
    GROUP BY 
        ctr_state
)
SELECT 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    ca_street_number,
    ca_street_name,
    ca_street_type,
    ca_suite_number,
    ca_city,
    ca_county,
    ca_state,
    ca_zip,
    ca_country,
    ca_gmt_offset,
    ca_location_type,
    ctr_total_return
FROM 
    customer_total_return ctr1
    JOIN customer ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN avg_returns ON ctr1.ctr_state = avg_returns.ctr_state
WHERE 
    ctr1.ctr_total_return > avg_returns.avg_state_return
    AND ca_state = 'TN'
ORDER BY 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    ca_street_number,
    ca_street_name,
    ca_street_type,
    ca_suite_number,
    ca_city,
    ca_county,
    ca_state,
    ca_zip,
    ca_country,
    ca_gmt_offset,
    ca_location_type,
    ctr_total_return
LIMIT 100;
```

### Corrections and Optimizations:
1. **Corrected Join Condition**: Fixed the join condition between `customer` and `customer_address` to correctly use `c_current_addr_sk` which matches the customer's current address key with the address key in the `customer_address` table.
2. **Predicate Pushdown**: Ensured that filters are applied as early as possible in the CTEs to reduce the amount of data processed.
3. **Common Sub-Expression Elimination**: Utilized a separate CTE `avg_returns` to calculate the average returns per state to avoid recalculating it multiple times in the main query.
4. **Efficient Join Order**: Ensured that smaller datasets are joined earlier where possible, and that the joins are structured to take advantage of indexes (assuming appropriate indexes on foreign keys and join columns).

This revised query should execute without errors and provide the intended optimizations.
