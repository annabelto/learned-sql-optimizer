I apologize for the repeated errors in previous responses. Let's ensure the optimized query maintains the exact logical output as the original query. Here is the corrected optimization:

### Original Query Review:
The original query involves multiple joins and filters, with specific focus on grouping and aggregating data based on ticket number, customer store key, and city. It also filters based on day of the week, year, and employee count, and includes conditions on household demographics.

### Corrected Optimization Approach:
1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This will still be applied to move conditions closer to where data is first accessed.
2. **Projection Pushdown**: Ensure only necessary columns are included in the subquery.
3. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Correctly identify and remove any redundant or always-true conditions.
4. **Correct Grouping**: Ensure the grouping in the subquery matches the original query's intent.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    substr(s_city, 1, 30) AS city_substr,
    ss_ticket_number,
    amt,
    profit
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        s_city,
        SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
    JOIN 
        household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    WHERE 
        (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 7 OR household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > -1)
        AND date_dim.d_dow = 1
        AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
        AND store.s_number_employees BETWEEN 200 AND 295
    GROUP BY 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        s_city
) AS ms
JOIN 
    customer ON ms.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    city_substr,
    profit
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to all joins to filter data early.
- **Projection Pushdown**: The subquery only selects columns necessary for the final output and aggregation.
- **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Kept the original conditions as they are necessary for correct filtering.
- **Correct Grouping**: Ensured the grouping fields are correctly applied as per the original query.

This revised query should now correctly reflect the optimizations while ensuring the output matches the original query.
