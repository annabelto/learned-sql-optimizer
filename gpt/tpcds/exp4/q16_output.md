Thank you for pointing out the error. It seems there was a mistake in referencing columns from the CTE in the join conditions. Let's correct this and ensure the query is syntactically correct and optimized.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH ValidSales AS (
    SELECT cs_order_number, cs_ext_ship_cost, cs_net_profit, cs_ship_date_sk, cs_ship_addr_sk, cs_call_center_sk
    FROM catalog_sales
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM catalog_returns cr1
        WHERE catalog_sales.cs_order_number = cr1.cr_order_number
    )
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM catalog_sales cs2
        WHERE catalog_sales.cs_order_number = cs2.cs_order_number
          AND catalog_sales.cs_warehouse_sk <> cs2.cs_warehouse_sk
    )
),
FilteredSales AS (
    SELECT vs.cs_order_number, vs.cs_ext_ship_cost, vs.cs_net_profit
    FROM ValidSales vs
    JOIN date_dim d ON vs.cs_ship_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON vs.cs_ship_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    JOIN call_center cc ON vs.cs_call_center_sk = cc.cc_call_center_sk
    WHERE d.d_date BETWEEN '2002-04-01' AND '2002-06-01'
      AND ca.ca_state = 'PA'
      AND cc.cc_county = 'Williamson County'
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cs_order_number) AS "order count",
       SUM(cs_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
       SUM(cs_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM FilteredSales
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT cs_order_number)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Corrections and Optimizations Made:
1. **Corrected Column References**: Fixed the column references in the CTEs to ensure that all necessary columns for joins and filters are included and correctly referenced in subsequent joins.
2. **Use of CTEs**: Continued use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to logically separate the processing steps, which can help in managing complexity and potentially improve performance by isolating expensive operations.
3. **Subquery Optimization**: Kept the `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` checks in the initial CTE to reduce the dataset early in the query execution process, which should help in reducing the workload in later stages of the query.
4. **Indexing Strategy**: It is crucial to ensure effective indexing on `cs_order_number`, `cs_warehouse_sk`, `cs_ship_date_sk`, `cs_ship_addr_sk`, `cs_call_center_sk`, `d_date_sk`, `ca_address_sk`, and `cc_call_center_sk`. Proper indexing is essential for efficient joins and WHERE clause conditions.

This revised query should now execute without errors and potentially offer better performance by ensuring that operations are streamlined and that the database can efficiently use indexes to speed up data retrieval and filtering. Make sure that the database statistics are up-to-date to help the query planner make optimal decisions.
