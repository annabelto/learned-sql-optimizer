To achieve a better performance optimization, we need to focus on refining the query further, possibly by optimizing the window function and ensuring that the data processed at each stage is minimized. Let's attempt a different approach to optimize the query:

### Original Query
```sql
select * 
from (
    select 
        i_category, i_class, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_moy, 
        sum(ss_sales_price) as sum_sales, 
        avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name) as avg_monthly_sales 
    from 
        item, store_sales, date_dim, store 
    where 
        ss_item_sk = i_item_sk and 
        ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and 
        ss_store_sk = s_store_sk and 
        d_year in (2001) and 
        (
            (i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics') and i_class in ('history','school-uniforms','audio')) or 
            (i_category in ('Men','Sports','Shoes') and i_class in ('pants','tennis','womens'))
        ) 
    group by 
        i_category, i_class, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_moy
) tmp1 
where 
    case 
        when (avg_monthly_sales <> 0) then (abs(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales) 
        else null 
    end > 0.1 
order by 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, s_store_name 
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_category, i_class, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_moy, 
    sum_sales, avg_monthly_sales
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_category, i_class, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_moy, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, 
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name) AS avg_monthly_sales 
    FROM 
        item
        JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001 AND 
        (
            (i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('history', 'school-uniforms', 'audio')) OR 
            (i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Shoes') AND i_class IN ('pants', 'tennis', 'womens'))
        )
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, i_class, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_moy
) AS subquery
WHERE 
    avg_monthly_sales <> 0 AND (ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales) > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, s_store_name 
LIMIT 100;
```

**Key Changes and Considerations:**
- **Explicit Joins**: Continued use of explicit JOINs for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Filtering Early**: Ensured that all filtering conditions are applied as early as possible in the query to reduce the volume of data being processed in later stages.
- **Window Function**: Kept the window function as it is crucial for the calculation but ensured it operates on the minimal necessary dataset.
- **Indexing**: It's crucial to ensure that indexes are present on `ss_item_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, `d_year`, `i_category`, and `i_class`. If not already indexed, consider adding indexes to these columns.
- **Avoiding Redundant Calculations**: The calculation for the condition in the outer query is streamlined to avoid any redundant operations.

This approach aims to optimize the query by ensuring efficient data handling and operations at each step, leveraging SQL constructs and PostgreSQL's capabilities effectively.
