To achieve a performance improvement over the original query, we need to focus on optimizing the query in a way that leverages PostgreSQL's strengths, such as its ability to efficiently execute joins and aggregate functions. We will also ensure that the query is structured to minimize the amount of data processed and the complexity of operations.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    substr(w.w_warehouse_name, 1, 20) AS warehouse_name,
    sm.sm_type,
    web.web_name,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk <= 30) AS "30 days",
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk > 30 AND ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk <= 60) AS "31-60 days",
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk > 60 AND ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk <= 90) AS "61-90 days",
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk > 90 AND ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk <= 120) AS "91-120 days",
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk > 120) AS ">120 days"
FROM 
    web_sales ws
JOIN 
    warehouse w ON ws.ws_warehouse_sk = w.w_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    ship_mode sm ON ws.ws_ship_mode_sk = sm.sm_ship_mode_sk
JOIN 
    web_site web ON ws.ws_web_site_sk = web.web_site_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON ws.ws_ship_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    d.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1223 AND 1234
GROUP BY 
    substr(w.w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm.sm_type,
    web.web_name
ORDER BY 
    substr(w.w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm.sm_type,
    web.web_name
LIMIT 100;
```

**Key Optimizations:**

1. **Use of FILTER in Aggregation**: Instead of using `CASE` statements within `SUM`, this query uses the `FILTER` clause for aggregation. This approach is typically more efficient in PostgreSQL as it directly integrates with the aggregation process, potentially reducing the overhead of conditional checks.

2. **Efficient Index Utilization**: This query assumes that there are effective indexes on the columns used in joins (`ws_warehouse_sk`, `ws_ship_mode_sk`, `ws_web_site_sk`, `ws_ship_date_sk`) and the filtering column (`d_month_seq`). Proper indexing is crucial for the performance of this query, especially given the join conditions and the WHERE clause.

3. **Simplified Expressions**: By using the `FILTER` clause, the query simplifies the expressions used in the aggregation, which can help PostgreSQL optimize the execution plan.

This version of the query is designed to leverage PostgreSQL's capabilities more effectively, particularly in how it handles conditional aggregations. If the performance does not improve, further analysis with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` would be necessary to diagnose deeper issues such as join strategies or hardware constraints.
