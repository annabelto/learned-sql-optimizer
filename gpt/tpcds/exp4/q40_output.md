To ensure that the optimized query not only matches the output of the original query but also potentially improves performance, we need to focus on refining the SQL with a more conservative approach, ensuring that any changes made are minimal and directly target known inefficiencies without altering the logical structure or expected results.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT w_state,
       i_item_id,
       SUM(CASE 
             WHEN (CAST(d_date AS DATE) < CAST('2001-05-02' AS DATE)) THEN cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0)
             ELSE 0
           END) AS sales_before,
       SUM(CASE 
             WHEN (CAST(d_date AS DATE) >= CAST('2001-05-02' AS DATE)) THEN cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0)
             ELSE 0
           END) AS sales_after
FROM catalog_sales
LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk),
     warehouse,
     item,
     date_dim
WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
  AND i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
  AND cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_date BETWEEN (CAST('2001-05-02' AS DATE) - 30) AND (CAST('2001-05-02' AS DATE) + 30)
GROUP BY w_state, i_item_id
ORDER BY w_state, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT w_state,
       i_item_id,
       SUM(CASE 
             WHEN d_date < DATE '2001-05-02' THEN cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0)
             ELSE 0
           END) AS sales_before,
       SUM(CASE 
             WHEN d_date >= DATE '2001-05-02' THEN cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0)
             ELSE 0
           END) AS sales_after
FROM catalog_sales
LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns ON cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk
JOIN warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
  AND d_date BETWEEN DATE '2001-05-02' - INTERVAL '30 days' AND DATE '2001-05-02' + INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY w_state, i_item_id
ORDER BY w_state, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Adjustments and Rationale:
- **Direct Date Comparison**: The date comparisons are directly translated to use standard SQL date literals and intervals, which should be functionally equivalent to the original CAST expressions but are cleaner and might be more index-friendly.
- **Explicit JOINs**: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potential optimization by the query planner.
- **Simplified Date Range**: Directly specified the date range in the WHERE clause using date literals to avoid additional computations or transformations.
- **Assumption of Index Utilization**: This query assumes that there are appropriate indexes on the `date_dim(d_date)`, `item(i_item_sk, i_current_price)`, and the join columns of `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns`. If these indexes are not present, they should be considered for creation to support this query.

This version of the query aims to maintain the exact logical structure of the original while incorporating minor syntactical improvements for potential performance gains. If performance does not meet expectations, further analysis with EXPLAIN plans would be necessary to diagnose and address specific bottlenecks.
