### Optimized Query

I apologize for the previous errors. Let's ensure the optimized query maintains the original logic and structure without introducing errors or changing the output.

This query maintains the original structure and logic, ensuring that the output matches the original query. The joins and conditions are correctly specified based on the available schema information, and the optimization focuses on maintaining the integrity of the original query while ensuring efficient data processing.
