To achieve a performance improvement over the original query while ensuring that the output remains consistent, we need to focus on subtle yet impactful optimizations. These optimizations will involve refining the execution strategy, possibly adjusting the aggregation and window function usage, and ensuring that the database's indexing and join strategies are optimally utilized.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    i_category, 
    i_class, 
    i_brand, 
    i_product_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    d_moy, 
    s_store_id, 
    sumsales, 
    rk
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        i_product_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_qoy, 
        d_moy, 
        s_store_id, 
        sumsales, 
        rank() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) AS rk
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            i_category, 
            i_class, 
            i_brand, 
            i_product_name, 
            d_year, 
            d_qoy, 
            d_moy, 
            s_store_id, 
            SUM(ss_sales_price * ss_quantity) AS sumsales
        FROM 
            store_sales
            JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
            JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
            JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        WHERE 
            d_month_seq BETWEEN 1217 AND 1228
        GROUP BY 
            ROLLUP(i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id)
    ) AS dw1
) AS dw2
WHERE 
    rk <= 100
ORDER BY 
    i_category, 
    i_class, 
    i_brand, 
    i_product_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    d_moy, 
    s_store_id, 
    sumsales, 
    rk
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Optimizations:

1. **Simplification of Aggregation**: The `COALESCE` function has been removed under the assumption that `ss_sales_price` and `ss_quantity` are not null. This simplifies the aggregation function, reducing computational overhead. If null values are possible, this change might need to be revisited.

2. **Efficient Use of Indexes**: Ensure that there are effective indexes on `ss_sold_date_sk`, `ss_item_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, and `d_date_sk`. An index on `d_month_seq` within `date_dim` is particularly crucial due to its use in the WHERE clause. Additionally, consider indexing the columns involved in the ORDER BY clause to speed up sorting operations.

3. **Execution Plan Review**: After applying these changes, it's important to review the execution plan to ensure that the database is using the most efficient path for data retrieval and aggregation. Look for opportunities to use index scans over full table scans and ensure that joins are performed optimally.

4. **Database Configuration and Tuning**: Depending on the results, further tuning of the database configuration might be necessary. This could involve adjusting memory allocations, considering parallel query execution, or other performance-related settings.

By focusing on these areas and ensuring that the database environment is configured to handle this type of query efficiently, we aim to achieve a performance improvement. If the performance is still not improved, further detailed analysis of the database system and workload might be required.
