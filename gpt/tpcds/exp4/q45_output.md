To ensure the optimized query performs better than the original, let's focus on refining the query further with a more detailed approach to optimization, particularly focusing on the execution plan and ensuring that the database's capabilities are effectively utilized.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, ca_city, SUM(ws_sales_price)
FROM 
    web_sales
JOIN 
    customer ON ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2000
JOIN 
    item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE 
    SUBSTR(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
    OR i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item WHERE i_item_sk IN (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29))
GROUP BY 
    ca_zip, ca_city
ORDER BY 
    ca_zip, ca_city
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes and Optimization Strategy:
1. **Maintain Logical Structure**: The query structure is kept similar to the original to ensure that the output remains unchanged. The subquery for `i_item_id` is preserved to ensure that the filtering on `i_item_id` is done correctly based on the `i_item_sk` values specified.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `d_qoy` and `d_year` are included directly in the join condition with `date_dim`. This ensures that the filtering is applied as early as possible, reducing the volume of data processed in subsequent operations.

3. **Efficient Use of Indexes**: The query assumes that there are effective indexes on the join columns (`ws_bill_customer_sk`, `c_customer_sk`, `c_current_addr_sk`, `ca_address_sk`, `ws_item_sk`, `i_item_sk`, `ws_sold_date_sk`, `d_date_sk`) and on the columns used in the WHERE clause (`ca_zip`, `i_item_id`). If these indexes are not present, they should be created as they can drastically improve the performance of joins and filters.

4. **Subquery Optimization**: The subquery used within the `OR` condition for `i_item_id` is necessary for maintaining the correct logic. To optimize this, ensure that the `item` table has an index on `i_item_sk` and `i_item_id` to make the subquery execution faster.

This approach ensures that the query remains logically equivalent to the original while attempting to optimize performance through better use of indexes and early filtering. The performance improvement will depend significantly on the database's physical design and the effectiveness of the indexes.
