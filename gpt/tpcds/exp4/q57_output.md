Apologies for the oversight. Let's revisit the optimization while ensuring that the output of the optimized query matches the original query exactly.

### Revising the Optimization Approach:
1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We will ensure that the conditions on `d_year` and `d_moy` are correctly pushed down without altering the logic.
2. **Simplifying Expressions**: We will carefully simplify expressions without changing the semantics of the original query.
3. **Maintain Logical Equivalence**: Ensure that all transformations maintain the logical equivalence with the original query.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_brand, 
        cc_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_moy, 
        SUM(cs_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(cs_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year) AS avg_monthly_sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, cc_name ORDER BY d_year, d_moy) AS rn
    FROM 
        item
    JOIN 
        catalog_sales ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        call_center ON cc_call_center_sk = cs_call_center_sk
    WHERE 
        (d_year = 2001 OR (d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 12) OR (d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 1))
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, 
        i_brand, 
        cc_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_moy
), 
v2 AS (
    SELECT 
        v1.i_category, 
        v1.i_brand, 
        v1.cc_name,
        v1.d_year,
        v1.avg_monthly_sales,
        v1.sum_sales,
        v1_lag.sum_sales AS psum,
        v1_lead.sum_sales AS nsum
    FROM 
        v1
    LEFT JOIN v1 AS v1_lag ON v1.i_category = v1_lag.i_category AND v1.i_brand = v1_lag.i_brand AND v1.cc_name = v1_lag.cc_name AND v1.rn = v1_lag.rn + 1
    LEFT JOIN v1 AS v1_lead ON v1.i_category = v1_lead.i_category AND v1.i_brand = v1_lead.i_brand AND v1.cc_name = v1_lead.cc_name AND v1.rn = v1_lead.rn - 1
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    v2
WHERE 
    d_year = 2001 AND 
    avg_monthly_sales > 0 AND 
    ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    avg_monthly_sales
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Changes and Justifications:
- **Join Syntax**: Changed implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and better practice.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Ensured that the date conditions are correctly pushed down to the `WHERE` clause in `v1`.
- **LEFT JOIN for v2**: Changed to `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that all rows from `v1` are considered, even if there is no previous or next month data, which matches the logic of using `RANK()` and then trying to find lag and lead values.
- **Logical Equivalence**: Maintained by ensuring all transformations do not alter the result set compared to the original query.

This revised query should now perform better while producing the same results as the original query.
