This optimized query aims to improve performance by ensuring efficient use of joins and filters, focusing on reducing the dataset as early as possible in the query execution process. The use of `INNER JOIN` is emphasized to ensure that only matching records are processed, potentially reducing the amount of data handled in the later stages of the query.
