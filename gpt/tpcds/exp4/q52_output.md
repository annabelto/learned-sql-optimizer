To achieve a performance improvement over the original query, we need to delve deeper into potential optimizations that might not have been fully explored previously. Given that the previous attempts did not yield a significant improvement, let's consider a more focused approach on execution efficiency and data retrieval strategies.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    item.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM 
    date_dim dt
INNER JOIN 
    store_sales ON dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
INNER JOIN 
    item ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
WHERE 
    dt.d_year = 2000 AND dt.d_moy = 12 AND item.i_manager_id = 1
GROUP BY 
    dt.d_year, item.i_brand_id, item.i_brand
ORDER BY 
    dt.d_year, ext_price DESC, brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Rationale for the Optimized Query:

1. **Maintain Explicit INNER JOINs**: The explicit INNER JOIN syntax is maintained to ensure clarity in how tables are connected, which aids the optimizer in understanding the query structure.

2. **Focused WHERE Clause**: The WHERE clause is kept concise and focused on the most selective conditions. This helps in reducing the dataset early in the query execution.

3. **Grouping and Ordering**: The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses are structured to ensure that the database can efficiently group and sort the data. The use of indexed columns in these clauses can significantly enhance performance.

### Additional Optimization Techniques:

1. **Index Optimization**: Ensure that there are efficient indexes on:
   - `date_dim.d_date_sk`, `store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk` for the join condition.
   - `store_sales.ss_item_sk`, `item.i_item_sk` for the join condition.
   - Composite index on `date_dim(d_year, d_moy)` for quick filtering on year and month.
   - `item.i_manager_id` for quick filtering on the item manager.

2. **Analyze Execution Plan**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check the execution plan. Look for any sequential scans that could be converted to index scans and ensure that joins are being executed as expected (e.g., hash join, nested loop).

3. **Query Tuning Based on Execution Plan**: Based on the findings from the execution plan, further tune the query. For example, if a certain join or operation is identified as a bottleneck, consider if changing the join order or method could help.

4. **Hardware and Configuration**: Ensure that the database server is adequately provisioned in terms of CPU and memory. Additionally, review PostgreSQL configuration settings such as `work_mem`, `maintenance_work_mem`, `effective_cache_size`, and others that could influence query performance.

5. **Partitioning and Sharding**: If applicable, consider partitioning large tables by relevant keys (e.g., date keys in `date_dim` or `store_sales`) to improve data access speed.

By applying these focused optimizations and continuously monitoring the query's performance, you should be able to achieve a noticeable improvement in execution time compared to the original query.
