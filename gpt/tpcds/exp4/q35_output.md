To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates into subqueries or joins where they can be applied earlier in the execution process, reducing the size of intermediate results and thus improving performance.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, and if the filtering can be achieved through other means (like a subquery with an EXISTS clause), the join can be eliminated.

3. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: If the same expression or subquery is used multiple times, it can be computed once and reused, reducing the amount of computation needed.

4. **Simplifying Aggregations**: Grouping by multiple columns that are functionally dependent can sometimes be simplified by reducing the number of groupings if the query semantics remain unchanged.

### Explanation:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to move the year and quarter conditions into the subqueries for `store_sales`, `web_sales`, and `catalog_sales`.
- **Join Elimination**: Not applied as all joins contribute to the final result.
- **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Not explicitly shown but implied in the consolidation of conditions within the subqueries.
- **Simplifying Aggregations**: Not applied as the grouping columns are necessary for the required output granularity.

This optimized query should perform better due to the reduced data size processed by the main query and the use of efficient subquery filters.
