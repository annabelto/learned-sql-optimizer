To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subquery or join condition to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution.
2. **Use of INNER JOIN instead of Cartesian Product**: Replace the implicit Cartesian product with explicit JOINs to improve readability and potentially allow the optimizer to better understand the join conditions.
3. **Column Pruning**: Ensure only necessary columns are fetched in the SELECT clause and in any subqueries or JOINs.
4. **Elimination of NULL checks in aggregation**: Replace the `CASE` statements with `FILTER` in the aggregation to directly apply conditions, simplifying the query and potentially improving performance.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    s_store_name, 
    s_store_id, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sun_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Monday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS mon_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Tuesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS tue_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Wednesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS wed_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Thursday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS thu_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Friday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS fri_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Saturday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sat_sales 
FROM 
    date_dim, 
    store_sales, 
    store 
WHERE 
    d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk 
    AND s_store_sk = ss_store_sk 
    AND s_gmt_offset = -5 
    AND d_year = 2000 
GROUP BY 
    s_store_name, 
    s_store_id 
ORDER BY 
    s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    s_store_name, 
    s_store_id, 
    SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name = 'Sunday') AS sun_sales, 
    SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name = 'Monday') AS mon_sales, 
    SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name = 'Tuesday') AS tue_sales, 
    SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name = 'Wednesday') AS wed_sales, 
    SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name = 'Thursday') AS thu_sales, 
    SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name = 'Friday') AS fri_sales, 
    SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name = 'Saturday') AS sat_sales 
FROM 
    store 
JOIN 
    store_sales ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk 
JOIN 
    date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk 
WHERE 
    s_gmt_offset = -5 
    AND d_year = 2000 
GROUP BY 
    s_store_name, 
    s_store_id 
ORDER BY 
    s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales 
LIMIT 100;
```

In the optimized query:
- We replaced the implicit joins with explicit `JOIN` clauses, which helps in understanding the relationships and can assist the query optimizer.
- We used the `FILTER` clause in the aggregation functions to directly apply the conditions, removing the need for `CASE` statements and potentially improving aggregation performance.
- The query structure is maintained, ensuring the output remains consistent with the original query's intent.
