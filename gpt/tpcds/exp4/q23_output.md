I apologize for the confusion in previous responses. Let's ensure the optimized query maintains the exact output structure and semantics as the original query.

### Original Query
The original query involves:
- Three Common Table Expressions (CTEs): `frequent_ss_items`, `max_store_sales`, and `best_ss_customer`.
- A final SELECT statement that sums up sales from `catalog_sales` and `web_sales` for specific conditions.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH frequent_ss_items AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_sk AS item_sk,
        d_date AS solddate,
        count(*) AS cnt
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2003
    GROUP BY 
        i_item_sk, d_date
    HAVING 
        count(*) > 4
), 
max_store_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        max(csales) AS tpcds_cmax
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            c_customer_sk,
            sum(ss_quantity * ss_sales_price) AS csales
        FROM 
            store_sales
            JOIN customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
            JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2003
        GROUP BY 
            c_customer_sk
    ) AS sales_summary
), 
best_ss_customer AS (
    SELECT 
        c_customer_sk
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    GROUP BY 
        c_customer_sk
    HAVING 
        sum(ss_quantity * ss_sales_price) > (0.95 * (SELECT tpcds_cmax FROM max_store_sales))
)
SELECT  
    sum(sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT 
        cs_quantity * cs_list_price AS sales
    FROM 
        catalog_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 7
        AND cs_item_sk IN (SELECT item_sk FROM frequent_ss_items)
        AND cs_bill_customer_sk IN (SELECT c_customer_sk FROM best_ss_customer)
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        ws_quantity * ws_list_price AS sales
    FROM 
        web_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 7
        AND ws_item_sk IN (SELECT item_sk FROM frequent_ss_items)
        AND ws_bill_customer_sk IN (SELECT c_customer_sk FROM best_ss_customer)
) AS sales_data
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the year and month filters directly into the WHERE clauses of the subqueries to reduce the amount of data processed.
2. **Join Optimization**: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potential performance improvement.
3. **Simplification of CTEs**: Removed unnecessary columns from the SELECT list in the CTEs to focus only on the necessary data.
4. **Maintaining Original Output**: Ensured that the final output remains a single sum of sales, matching the original query's intent.

These changes aim to make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and reorganizing the operations for better performance while ensuring the output remains consistent with the original query.
