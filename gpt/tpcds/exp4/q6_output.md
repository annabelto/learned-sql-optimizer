To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows early in the query processing, which can significantly decrease the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages.

2. **Subquery Flattening**: This rule attempts to convert subqueries into joins or to simplify them, which can be more efficient than executing them as independent subqueries.

3. **Join Reordering**: This involves rearranging the joins to minimize the size of intermediate results, which can reduce query execution time.

4. **Use of Temporary Aggregates**: This involves creating temporary tables for complex subqueries that are used multiple times, reducing the need to compute these multiple times.

5. **Elimination of Distinct**: When used in subqueries that are part of an EXISTS or IN clause, the DISTINCT keyword can often be removed without changing the semantics of the query.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Push the predicates related to `date_dim` and `item` deeper into the query to reduce the number of rows processed.
2. **Subquery Flattening**: The subquery for `d_month_seq` can be joined with the `date_dim` table.
3. **Use of Temporary Aggregates**: Create a temporary aggregate for the average price calculation in the `item` table.
4. **Elimination of Distinct**: Remove the `distinct` keyword from the subquery calculating `d_month_seq` as it is redundant in this context.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH avg_price AS (
    SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) AS avg_price
    FROM item
    GROUP BY i_category
),
month_seq AS (
    SELECT d_month_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM customer_address a
JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
JOIN store_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
JOIN date_dim d ON s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN avg_price ap ON i.i_category = ap.i_category
JOIN month_seq ms ON d.d_month_seq = ms.d_month_seq
WHERE i.i_current_price > 1.2 * ap.avg_price
GROUP BY a.ca_state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query uses temporary tables for average price and month sequence, pushes predicates closer to where data is fetched, and removes unnecessary `distinct` keywords. This should lead to improved performance by reducing the amount of data processed and the complexity of subqueries.
