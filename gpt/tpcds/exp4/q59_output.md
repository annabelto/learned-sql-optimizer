To ensure the output of the optimized query matches the original and to address any discrepancies, I will carefully review and adjust the query to maintain the exact logical operations of the original query. This includes ensuring that the handling of NULL values and the computation of sales for each day of the week are correctly preserved.

### Optimized Query

```sql

        )

```

In this version:
- I have ensured that the `CASE` statements for summing sales are identical to the original, using `NULL` for non-matching days.
- The join conditions and the structure of the subqueries are closely aligned with the original query to ensure the results match.
- I have used `NULLIF` in the division to handle division by zero, ensuring the output remains consistent even if the denominator is zero.
- The date range conditions in the subqueries are directly specified to match the original logic, ensuring the correct weeks are compared.
