Given the close performance between the original and the previously optimized queries, and considering the need for further optimization, we will focus on refining the query with a more detailed approach to indexing and join conditions. This will involve ensuring that the query is structured in a way that maximizes the use of indexes, which can be crucial for performance in large datasets.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    cd.cd_gender, 
    cd.cd_marital_status, 
    cd.cd_education_status, 
    COUNT(*) AS cnt1, 
    cd.cd_purchase_estimate, 
    COUNT(*) AS cnt2, 
    cd.cd_credit_rating, 
    COUNT(*) AS cnt3 
FROM 
    customer c
INNER JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
INNER JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd ON cd.cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk
WHERE 
    ca.ca_state IN ('IL', 'TX', 'ME')
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM 
            store_sales ss
        INNER JOIN 
            date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
            AND d.d_year = 2002
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM 
            web_sales ws
        INNER JOIN 
            date_dim d ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            ws.ws_bill_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
            AND d.d_year = 2002
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM 
            catalog_sales cs
        INNER JOIN 
            date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            cs.cs_ship_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
            AND d.d_year = 2002
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
GROUP BY 
    cd.cd_gender, 
    cd.cd_marital_status, 
    cd.cd_education_status, 
    cd.cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd.cd_credit_rating
ORDER BY 
    cd.cd_gender, 
    cd.cd_marital_status, 
    cd.cd_education_status, 
    cd.cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd.cd_credit_rating
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Changes and Justifications:
1. **Explicit INNER JOINs**: The use of explicit `INNER JOIN` syntax clarifies the mandatory nature of these joins, which can help the SQL optimizer make better decisions about join strategies and the use of indexes.

2. **Optimized EXISTS and NOT EXISTS Subqueries**: The subqueries have been optimized to use `SELECT 1` instead of `SELECT *`, reducing the data processing overhead. The join conditions within these subqueries are aligned with likely indexed columns, such as `ss_sold_date_sk` and `ws_sold_date_sk`.

3. **Indexing Strategy**: This query assumes that there are effective indexes on the join columns (`c_current_addr_sk`, `cd_demo_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, `ws_sold_date_sk`, `cs_sold_date_sk`) and the columns used in the WHERE clause conditions (`ca_state`, `d_year`, `d_moy`). If these indexes are not present, they should be considered for creation to improve query performance.

4. **Maintaining Original Structure**: The core structure of the query, including the WHERE clause and the GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses, remains unchanged. This maintains the original logic while attempting to enhance performance through better use of indexing and join conditions.

This approach aims to subtly refine the query to better align with database optimization capabilities, particularly around the use of indexes and efficient join operations.
