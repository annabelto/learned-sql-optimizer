To further optimize the query, we need to focus on the most impactful areas such as join reduction, efficient aggregation, and minimizing the overhead of window functions if possible. Given that the previous optimizations did not yield a significant improvement, we will attempt a different approach focusing on the execution plan and the use of efficient SQL constructs.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH ranked_states AS (
    SELECT 
        s_state,
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS state_profit
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        store ON store.s_store_sk = store_sales.ss_store_sk
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON date_dim.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
    WHERE 
        date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231
    GROUP BY 
        s_state
    ORDER BY 
        state_profit DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
, sales_summary AS (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS total_sum,
        s_state,
        s_county,
        grouping(s_state) + grouping(s_county) AS lochierarchy
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        store ON store.s_store_sk = store_sales.ss_store_sk
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON date_dim.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
    WHERE 
        date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231
        AND s_state IN (SELECT s_state FROM ranked_states)
    GROUP BY 
        ROLLUP(s_state, s_county)
)
SELECT 
    total_sum,
    s_state,
    s_county,
    lochierarchy,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY lochierarchy, 
        CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN s_state END 
        ORDER BY total_sum DESC
    ) AS rank_within_parent
FROM 
    sales_summary
ORDER BY 
    lochierarchy DESC,
    CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN s_state END,
    rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Changes and Optimizations:
1. **Pre-aggregation of State Profits**: The subquery `ranked_states` now directly computes the sum of `ss_net_profit` for each state and orders them to pick the top 5 states. This reduces the complexity by avoiding the use of a window function for ranking within the subquery.

2. **Simplified Main Query**: The main query now uses a pre-aggregated result (`sales_summary`) which computes the total sum and grouping hierarchy in advance. This allows the final SELECT to focus solely on applying the rank based on pre-computed aggregates.

3. **Efficient Use of Window Functions**: The window function is now applied only once in the final SELECT, which should be more efficient as it operates on a potentially reduced dataset (after filtering by top states and pre-aggregating).

4. **Reduced Redundancy**: By pre-aggregating and limiting the dataset early, the query reduces redundancy and the volume of data processed in later stages.

This approach aims to optimize the query by reducing the number of rows processed in the window function and by simplifying the operations involved in computing the final result.
