To achieve a better optimization, we need to focus on minimizing the execution of redundant subqueries and improving the efficiency of the joins and aggregations. Given the previous attempts, let's refine the approach by optimizing the date filtering and ensuring that the joins are as efficient as possible.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH target_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date IN ('2001-07-13', '2001-09-10', '2001-11-16')
),
relevant_weeks AS (
    SELECT d_week_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM target_dates)
),
filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_week_seq IN (SELECT d_week_seq FROM relevant_weeks)
),
sr_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(sr_return_quantity) AS sr_item_qty
    FROM store_returns
    JOIN item ON sr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE sr_returned_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM filtered_dates)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
cr_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(cr_return_quantity) AS cr_item_qty
    FROM catalog_returns
    JOIN item ON cr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE cr_returned_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM filtered_dates)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
wr_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(wr_return_quantity) AS wr_item_qty
    FROM web_returns
    JOIN item ON wr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE wr_returned_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM filtered_dates)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT
    sr_items.item_id,
    sr_item_qty,
    sr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS sr_dev,
    cr_item_qty,
    cr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS cr_dev,
    wr_item_qty,
    wr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS wr_dev,
    (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 AS average
FROM sr_items
JOIN cr_items ON sr_items.item_id = cr_items.item_id
JOIN wr_items ON sr_items.item_id = wr_items.item_id
ORDER BY sr_items.item_id, sr_item_qty
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Optimized Date Filtering**: The query now uses a `target_dates` CTE to directly fetch the `d_date_sk` values for the specific target dates. This list is then used to determine the relevant `d_week_seq` values, which in turn are used to fetch all `d_date_sk` values for those weeks (`filtered_dates`). This approach minimizes the number of scans on the `date_dim` table.

2. **Efficient Joins**: The joins between the returns tables (`store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, `web_returns`) and the `item` table are maintained, but the filtering is now more direct, using the pre-filtered `d_date_sk` values from `filtered_dates`. This ensures that only relevant data is processed in the joins.

3. **Aggregation and Join Optimization**: By ensuring that the data being joined and aggregated is precisely what is needed, the query reduces unnecessary computations and data handling.

This revised query should perform better by reducing the complexity of date filtering and ensuring that joins and aggregations are executed with minimal overhead.
