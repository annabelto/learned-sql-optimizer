To achieve a better performance than the original query, we need to focus on optimizing the existing structure without introducing additional complexity that might hinder performance. We'll refine the original query by ensuring efficient use of indexes, minimizing the data processed, and optimizing join conditions.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    c.c_last_name,
    c.c_first_name,
    ca.ca_city,
    bought_city,
    ss.ss_ticket_number,
    extended_price,
    extended_tax,
    list_price
FROM 
    (SELECT 
        ss.ss_ticket_number,
        ss.ss_customer_sk,
        ca.ca_city AS bought_city,
        SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS extended_price,
        SUM(ss.ss_ext_list_price) AS list_price,
        SUM(ss.ss_ext_tax) AS extended_tax
    FROM 
        store_sales ss
    JOIN 
        date_dim dd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = dd.d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        store s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
    JOIN 
        household_demographics hd ON ss.ss_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
    JOIN 
        customer_address ca ON ss.ss_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        dd.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
        AND (hd.hd_dep_count = 3 OR hd.hd_vehicle_count = 4)
        AND dd.d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)
        AND s.s_city IN ('Fairview', 'Midway')
    GROUP BY 
        ss.ss_ticket_number, ss.ss_customer_sk, ca.ca_city
    ) ss
JOIN 
    customer c ON ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    ca.ca_city <> ss.bought_city
ORDER BY 
    c.c_last_name, ss.ss_ticket_number
LIMIT 100;
```

**Optimization Strategies Applied:**
1. **Efficient Use of Indexes**: The query assumes that there are appropriate indexes on `ss_sold_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, `ss_hdemo_sk`, `ss_addr_sk`, `d_date_sk`, `s_store_sk`, `hd_demo_sk`, `ca_address_sk`, `c_customer_sk`, and `c_current_addr_sk`. If these indexes are not present, they should be considered as they can significantly improve join and filter operations.
2. **Filter and Join Optimization**: The filters and joins are designed to minimize the amount of data processed as early as possible in the query execution. This includes filtering on `date_dim`, `store`, and `household_demographics` before performing aggregation, which reduces the volume of data that needs to be grouped.
3. **Simplification of Expressions**: The year filter `dd.d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)` is directly stated, which should help in using any available indexes on the `d_year` column effectively.

This query is structured to leverage PostgreSQL's strengths in handling joins and aggregations efficiently, assuming proper indexing and up-to-date statistics. The performance should ideally be better or at least comparable to the original query while maintaining or improving clarity and maintainability.
