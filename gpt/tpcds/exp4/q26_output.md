To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates (filter conditions) closer to the data source. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to reduce the size of intermediate results. Smaller intermediate results generally lead to faster query execution times.

3. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Instead of using commas in the FROM clause, using explicit JOIN syntax can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it makes the join conditions clearer and allows the database engine to optimize better.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Removing unnecessary columns from the SELECT and JOIN clauses can reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, 
    AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, 
    AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, 
    AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2002
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
JOIN 
    promotion ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id 
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: I moved the conditions related to `date_dim`, `customer_demographics`, and `promotion` directly into the respective JOIN conditions. This ensures that these filters are applied as soon as the tables are accessed, reducing the amount of data that flows into subsequent operations.

2. **Join Reordering**: The order of joins was rearranged to start with the `item` table, which is directly joined with `catalog_sales`. This might be beneficial if `item` or `catalog_sales` are smaller than other tables, although the optimal order can depend on the actual data distribution and should ideally be tested.

3. **Use of Explicit Joins**: I replaced the commas in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax, which makes the join conditions explicit and can help the database optimizer.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: This rule wasnâ€™t applied as the query does not select any redundant columns; it only selects columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in join conditions.

These changes should help in optimizing the query execution by reducing the amount of data processed and clarifying the join conditions for the database's query optimizer.
