To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the complexity and improving the performance of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates (filter conditions) as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Constant Folding**: This rule simplifies expressions involving constants. For example, replacing `1998+1` with `1999` and `1998+2` with `2000`.

3. **Join Condition Simplification**: Simplify and clarify the join conditions to make the query easier to understand and potentially reveal further optimization opportunities.

4. **Eliminate Redundant Conditions**: Remove or combine conditions that are redundant or that logically imply one another.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name,
    MAX(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantity,
    MAX(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantity,
    MAX(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantity
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk
                   AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
                   AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk
                   AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim AS d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim AS d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim AS d3 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
WHERE 
    d1.d_moy = 4 
    AND d1.d_year = 1998
    AND d2.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 7
    AND d2.d_year = 1998
    AND d3.d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved all relevant filters closer to the table scans, which helps in reducing the amount of data that needs to be joined.
- **Constant Folding**: Replaced `1998+1` with `1999` and `1998+2` with `2000` in the `d3.d_year` condition.
- **Join Condition Simplification**: Explicitly used JOINs instead of commas for clarity and to emphasize the join conditions.
- **Eliminate Redundant Conditions**: Ensured that no redundant conditions are present after reformatting.

These changes should help in improving the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data processed and clarifying the execution plan for the database engine.
