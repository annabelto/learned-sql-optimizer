To ensure the optimized query performs better than the original while maintaining the same output, let's focus on refining the query without altering the logical structure significantly. We will aim to optimize the query by ensuring efficient use of indexes and minimizing the data processed through careful placement of conditions.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim
WHERE cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND (substr(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
       OR ca_state IN ('CA', 'WA', 'GA')
       OR cs_sales_price > 500)
  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_qoy = 2
  AND d_year = 2001
GROUP BY ca_zip
ORDER BY ca_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_qoy = 2 AND d_year = 2001
WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
   OR ca_state IN ('CA', 'WA', 'GA')
   OR substr(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
GROUP BY ca_zip
ORDER BY ca_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes and Optimization Techniques:
1. **Join Conditions and Filtering**: The join conditions are kept intact, and the filtering conditions related to the `date_dim` table are moved directly into the join clause. This ensures that only relevant date records are joined, reducing the size of the dataset early in the query execution.

2. **Efficient Use of Indexes**:
   - **Date Dimension**: An index on `date_dim(d_date_sk, d_qoy, d_year)` is assumed, which would make the filtering on year and quarter very efficient.
   - **Customer and Customer Address**: Indexes on `customer(c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk)` and `customer_address(ca_address_sk)` are assumed to be used efficiently due to the join conditions.
   - **Catalog Sales**: An index on `catalog_sales(cs_bill_customer_sk, cs_sold_date_sk, cs_sales_price)` would help in efficiently filtering and joining on these columns.

3. **Filter Placement**: The filters on `ca_zip`, `ca_state`, and `cs_sales_price` are placed in the WHERE clause after the joins. This allows the database to use indexes effectively if available and reduces the amount of data that needs to be grouped and aggregated.

4. **Maintaining Logical Equivalence**: The core logical structure of the query remains unchanged to ensure that the output matches the original query.

This optimized query is designed to leverage database indexing effectively and reduce the computational load by filtering data earlier in the execution process. If performance does not improve as expected, further analysis may be required to understand the data distribution, existing indexes, and possibly the need for additional indexes or even materialized views for frequently accessed summary data.
