To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Remove duplicate or redundant conditions to simplify the query.
3. **Constant Folding**: Evaluate expressions involving constants at compile time rather than at runtime.
4. **Join Condition Simplification**: Simplify join conditions and ensure they are using the most efficient types of joins.

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Join Conversion**: Converted implicit joins to explicit joins for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved conditions related to `date_dim`, `store`, and `household_demographics` directly into the respective join conditions.
- **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Removed redundant checks for `household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0` as it is already ensured by the division condition.
- **Constant Folding**: Simplified the `date_dim.d_year` condition by directly listing the years.
- **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Simplified the repeated values in `store.s_county` condition.
