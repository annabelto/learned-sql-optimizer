To further optimize the query, we need to consider additional strategies that might help in reducing the execution time or improving the efficiency of the query. Here are some additional steps we can take:

1. **Index Utilization**: Ensure that there are appropriate indexes on the columns used in the joins and where clauses. This is crucial for performance but cannot be directly reflected in the query text. You would need to ensure indexes exist on `ss_sold_time_sk`, `ss_hdemo_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, `t_hour`, `t_minute`, `hd_dep_count`, and `s_store_name`.

2. **Materialized Views**: If the query is run frequently with the same parameters, consider using a materialized view to store the result of a part of this query, especially the joins and filters that don't change often.

3. **Cost-Based Optimization Hints**: Although PostgreSQL does not support SQL hints directly like some other databases (e.g., Oracle), you can configure the planner to use more or less of the indexes, or adjust the statistics targets for more accurate planning.

4. **Recheck Join Orders and Conditions**: Although the join order was adjusted in the previous optimization attempt, it's worth revisiting this based on actual data distribution and table sizes.

### Revisiting the Query for Further Optimization:

Given that the previous optimization did not yield a better performance, let's attempt a different approach while ensuring that the database has appropriate indexes.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM store_sales
JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk AND store.s_store_name = 'ese'
JOIN household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 0
JOIN time_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk AND time_dim.t_hour = 8 AND time_dim.t_minute >= 30
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Join Conditions Enhanced**: Each join condition now includes the relevant filtering directly. This can help in leveraging indexes that include both the join column and the filter column, reducing the number of rows processed in each step.
- **Limit Placement**: The `LIMIT` is still at the end of the query, which is appropriate as it does not affect the count in this context but would help if the query were modified to retrieve individual records.

### Note on Indexes:
Make sure the following indexes exist:
- On `store_sales`: Composite indexes on `(ss_store_sk, ss_hdemo_sk, ss_sold_time_sk)` could be beneficial.
- On `store`: An index on `(s_store_sk, s_store_name)`.
- On `household_demographics`: An index on `(hd_demo_sk, hd_dep_count)`.
- On `time_dim`: An index on `(t_time_sk, t_hour, t_minute)`.

These indexes are suggested based on the join and where conditions and could significantly impact performance if not already present.
