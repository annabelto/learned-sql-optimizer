To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filtering conditions closer to the data sources. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to minimize the size of intermediate results. It's particularly effective when combined with predicate pushdown.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax (e.g., INNER JOIN) for better readability and control over join conditions.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Grouping Attributes**: If certain attributes in the GROUP BY clause are functionally dependent on others, they can be removed. However, in this query, all grouping attributes are necessary for the correct semantic.

### Application of Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Apply filters on `item.i_manager_id`, `dt.d_moy`, and `dt.d_year` directly after the tables are mentioned.
   
2. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert the query to use explicit JOINs which are easier to read and manage.

3. **Join Reordering**: Although the optimal join order might depend on the actual data distribution and indexes available, a common heuristic is to reduce the size of join results early by filtering and joining smaller tables first.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price)
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    store_sales ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim dt ON dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
WHERE 
    item.i_manager_id = 1
    AND dt.d_moy = 11
    AND dt.d_year = 1998
GROUP BY 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category
ORDER BY 
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) DESC,
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Filters on `item.i_manager_id`, `dt.d_moy`, and `dt.d_year` are applied directly in the WHERE clause, reducing the amount of data that needs to be joined and grouped.

- **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query now clearly specifies the type of joins and the joining conditions, improving readability and potentially allowing the database engine to optimize the join order and execution.

- **Join Reordering**: The query starts with the `item` table, which is filtered by `i_manager_id`, potentially reducing the size of the dataset early in the execution plan. This is followed by joining with `store_sales` and then `date_dim`, which is filtered by `d_moy` and `d_year`.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time of the query by minimizing the amount of data processed and clearly defining join conditions and orders.
