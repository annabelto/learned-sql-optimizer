To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. The rules applied here include:

1. **Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy within subqueries and expressions. In the given query, the subquery to fetch `d_week_seq` for a specific date ('2001-06-16') is repeated multiple times. We can compute this once and reuse it.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**: This optimization moves predicates into subqueries to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution plan.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute additional columns or affects the result, it can be eliminated. However, in this query, all joins are necessary for the final result.

4. **Using Joins Instead of IN Clauses**: Replace `IN` clauses with joins when possible to allow the optimizer more flexibility in terms of join algorithms and order.

5. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify arithmetic expressions where possible to reduce computation complexity.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH date_key AS (
    SELECT d_week_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date = '2001-06-16'
),
ss_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id,
           SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ss_item_rev
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_week_seq = (SELECT d_week_seq FROM date_key)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
cs_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id,
           SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS cs_item_rev
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_week_seq = (SELECT d_week_seq FROM date_key)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
ws_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id,
           SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS ws_item_rev
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_week_seq = (SELECT d_week_seq FROM date_key)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT ss_items.item_id,
       ss_item_rev,
       ss_item_rev / ((ss_item_rev + cs_item_rev + ws_item_rev) / 3) * 100 AS ss_dev,
       cs_item_rev,
       cs_item_rev / ((ss_item_rev + cs_item_rev + ws_item_rev) / 3) * 100 AS cs_dev,
       ws_item_rev,
       ws_item_rev / ((ss_item_rev + cs_item_rev + ws_item_rev) / 3) * 100 AS ws_dev,
       (ss_item_rev + cs_item_rev + ws_item_rev) / 3 AS average
FROM ss_items
JOIN cs_items ON ss_items.item_id = cs_items.item_id
JOIN ws_items ON ss_items.item_id = ws_items.item_id
WHERE ss_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * cs_item_rev AND 1.1 * cs_item_rev
  AND ss_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ws_item_rev AND 1.1 * ws_item_rev
  AND cs_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ss_item_rev AND 1.1 * ss_item_rev
  AND cs_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ws_item_rev AND 1.1 * ws_item_rev
  AND ws_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ss_item_rev AND 1.1 * ss_item_rev
  AND ws_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * cs_item_rev AND 1.1 * cs_item_rev
ORDER BY item_id, ss_item_rev
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query reduces redundancy by computing the `d_week_seq` only once and reuses it in the subqueries. It also replaces the `IN` clause with a join to the `date_key` CTE, which can be more efficient depending on the database's query planner and the underlying data distribution.
