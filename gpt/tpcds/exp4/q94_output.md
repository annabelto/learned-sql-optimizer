To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not affect the result.
3. **Subquery Flattening**: Convert correlated subqueries to joins where possible to enable better optimization by the query planner.
4. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control.
5. **Elimination of ORDER BY in Aggregation**: Since the query uses LIMIT with aggregation without a meaningful ORDER BY (ordering by the result of an aggregate function which is the same for all rows), the ORDER BY clause can be removed.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple tables and checks for the existence of certain conditions using subqueries. It also uses implicit joins and has an ORDER BY clause on an aggregated column, which is redundant when combined with LIMIT if the ORDER BY does not affect the result.

### Applying Rewrite Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Push predicates related to `date_dim`, `customer_address`, and `web_site` directly into the respective JOIN conditions.
2. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Convert the query to use explicit JOIN syntax.
3. **Subquery Flattening**: The EXISTS subquery can be rewritten as a JOIN, although it's a bit tricky since it involves a semi-join (exists). We'll keep the EXISTS for clarity and performance considerations as PostgreSQL handles semi-joins efficiently.
4. **Elimination of ORDER BY**: Remove the ORDER BY clause as it is redundant when used with COUNT(DISTINCT ...) and LIMIT.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number) AS "order count",
    SUM(ws1.ws_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
    SUM(ws1.ws_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM
    web_sales ws1
JOIN
    date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    AND date_dim.d_date BETWEEN '2002-5-01' AND (CAST('2002-5-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 days')
JOIN
    customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
    AND customer_address.ca_state = 'OK'
JOIN
    web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site.web_site_sk
    AND web_site.web_company_name = 'pri'
WHERE
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM web_sales ws2
        WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
        AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM web_returns wr1
        WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number
    )
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data movement and more efficient use of indexes and joins. The explicit JOIN syntax also helps in understanding the query better and ensures that each join is correctly represented with its intended conditions.
