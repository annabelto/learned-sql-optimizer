I apologize for the previous misunderstandings. Let's ensure that the optimized query matches the output of the original query accurately. I will carefully review the original query and ensure that the optimized version adheres to its logic while attempting to improve performance.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH web_v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        ws_item_sk AS item_sk, 
        d_date, 
        SUM(ws_sales_price) AS sales,
        SUM(SUM(ws_sales_price)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY ws_item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS cume_sales
    FROM 
        web_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1212 AND 1223
        AND ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        ws_item_sk, d_date
),
store_v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        ss_item_sk AS item_sk, 
        d_date, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sales,
        SUM(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY ss_item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS cume_sales
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1212 AND 1223
        AND ss_item_sk IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        ss_item_sk, d_date
),
combined_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) AS item_sk,
        COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) AS d_date,
        web.cume_sales AS web_sales,
        store.cume_sales AS store_sales
    FROM 
        web_v1 web
    FULL OUTER JOIN 
        store_v1 store ON web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date
),
cumulative_max AS (
    SELECT 
        item_sk, 
        d_date, 
        web_sales, 
        store_sales,
        MAX(web_sales) OVER (
            PARTITION BY item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS web_cumulative,
        MAX(store_sales) OVER (
            PARTITION BY item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS store_cumulative
    FROM 
        combined_sales
)
SELECT 
    item_sk, 
    d_date, 
    web_sales, 
    store_sales
FROM 
    cumulative_max
WHERE 
    web_cumulative > store_cumulative
ORDER BY 
    item_sk, 
    d_date
LIMIT 100;
```

This query should now correctly replicate the logic of the original query while incorporating optimizations for better performance. The key adjustments include ensuring that the window functions are applied correctly and that the join conditions match those of the original query. This version should provide the correct output and potentially better performance.
