To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to reduce the size of intermediate results, which can decrease the overall query execution time.
3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated tables) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and often better performance due to clearer join conditions.
4. **Elimination of Redundant GROUP BY**: Since the query uses all group by columns in the select list and there are no aggregate functions, the GROUP BY is redundant and can be removed.
5. **Constant Expression Evaluation**: Evaluate expressions involving constants at compile time rather than at runtime.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
FROM item, inventory, date_dim, catalog_sales 
WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 29 AND 29 + 30 
  AND inv_item_sk = i_item_sk 
  AND d_date_sk = inv_date_sk 
  AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-03-29' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-03-29' AS DATE) + 60) 
  AND i_manufact_id IN (705, 742, 777, 944) 
  AND inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500 
  AND cs_item_sk = i_item_sk 
GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
ORDER BY i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax and Join Reordering**:
   - Convert implicit joins to explicit joins.
   - Prioritize joining smaller tables or the ones with more restrictive conditions earlier.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   - Push conditions into the JOIN clauses where applicable.

3. **Constant Expression Evaluation**:
   - Pre-calculate the constant expressions.

4. **Elimination of Redundant GROUP BY**:
   - Remove the GROUP BY clause as it is redundant in this context.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
FROM item
JOIN inventory ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk AND inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-03-29' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-03-29' AS DATE) + 60)
JOIN catalog_sales ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 29 AND 59
  AND i_manufact_id IN (705, 742, 777, 944)
ORDER BY i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

In this optimized query:
- The explicit JOIN syntax clarifies the relationships and conditions between tables.
- Conditions are pushed down to be closer to where the data is read, particularly in the JOIN clauses.
- The constant expression `29 + 30` is simplified to `59`.
- The redundant GROUP BY clause is removed, simplifying the execution plan.
