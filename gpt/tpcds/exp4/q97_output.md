To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates into the subqueries to reduce the size of intermediate results and the cost of joins.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries.
3. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if possible.
4. **Column Pruning**: Select only the necessary columns in the subqueries to reduce the amount of data processed.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves two CTEs (`ssci` and `csci`) that select from `store_sales` and `catalog_sales` respectively, joined with `date_dim` on the date keys and filtered by a range of `d_month_seq`. The main query then performs a full outer join on these CTEs based on customer and item keys, and computes aggregates to count exclusive and overlapping customers between store and catalog sales.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown
We can push the conditions on `d_month_seq` directly into the subqueries to reduce the number of rows early in the query execution.

#### 2. Column Pruning
In the CTEs, only the customer and item keys are needed for the final join and aggregation. We ensure that only these columns are selected.

#### 3. Common Sub-expression Elimination
There are no redundant calculations in the given query, so this rule does not apply here.

#### 4. Join Elimination
All joins are necessary for the final result, so this rule does not apply here.

### Optimized Query
```sql
with ssci as (
    select ss_customer_sk as customer_sk, ss_item_sk as item_sk
    from store_sales
    join date_dim on ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    where d_month_seq between 1199 and 1210
    group by ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk
),
csci as (
    select cs_bill_customer_sk as customer_sk, cs_item_sk as item_sk
    from catalog_sales
    join date_dim on cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    where d_month_seq between 1199 and 1210
    group by cs_bill_customer_sk, cs_item_sk
)
select
    sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is not null and csci.customer_sk is null then 1 else 0 end) as store_only,
    sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is null and csci.customer_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) as catalog_only,
    sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is not null and csci.customer_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) as store_and_catalog
from ssci
full outer join csci on ssci.customer_sk = csci.customer_sk and ssci.item_sk = csci.item_sk
limit 100;
```

### Explanation
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The `where` clause is moved into the CTEs to filter rows as early as possible.
- **Column Pruning**: Only necessary columns (`customer_sk` and `item_sk`) are selected in the CTEs.
- The `limit 100` in the main query remains unchanged as it does not impact the aggregation logic but limits the output rows, which is likely intended for testing or partial result visualization.
