To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the complexity and improving the performance of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows early in the execution plan, which can significantly decrease the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a table in a join operation does not affect the result (i.e., not used in SELECT, WHERE, or having any aggregate functions applied on its columns), it can be removed from the query.

3. **Simplifying OR Conditions**: By analyzing the conditions, especially those involving ranges or similar comparisons, we can sometimes simplify or reorganize them to make the query more efficient.

4. **Use of IN instead of OR for the same column**: This can make the query more readable and sometimes allows the database to optimize the query execution plan better.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(ss_quantity),
    AVG(ss_ext_sales_price),
    AVG(ss_ext_wholesale_cost),
    SUM(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = ss_cdemo_sk
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    d_year = 2001
    AND cd_marital_status IN ('M', 'D', 'W')
    AND (
        (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'College' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 100.00 AND 150.00 AND hd_dep_count = 3)
        OR (cd_marital_status = 'D' AND cd_education_status = 'Primary' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00 AND hd_dep_count = 1)
        OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 150.00 AND 200.00 AND hd_dep_count = 1)
    )
    AND ca_country = 'United States'
    AND (
        (ca_state IN ('IL', 'TN', 'TX') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 100 AND 200)
        OR (ca_state IN ('WY', 'OH', 'ID') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 150 AND 300)
        OR (ca_state IN ('MS', 'SC', 'IA') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 50 AND 250)
    );
```

### Explanation:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to move conditions on `d_year`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, `ss_sales_price`, `hd_dep_count`, `ca_country`, `ca_state`, and `ss_net_profit` closer to their respective table scans.
- **Join Elimination**: Not applied as all tables seem relevant to the query.
- **Simplifying OR Conditions**: Conditions involving `cd_marital_status` and `ca_state` were grouped to simplify the logic and potentially allow better use of indexes.
- **Use of IN instead of OR**: Applied for `cd_marital_status` and `ca_state` to simplify the query and potentially improve performance.
