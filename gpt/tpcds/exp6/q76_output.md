To further optimize the query, I will focus on ensuring that the query execution plan is as efficient as possible. This might involve revisiting the join conditions and ensuring that the most selective filters are applied as early as possible in the query execution. Additionally, I will ensure that the query is structured in a way that leverages indexes effectively.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    channel, 
    col_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    i_category, 
    COUNT(*) AS sales_cnt, 
    SUM(ext_sales_price) AS sales_amt 
FROM 
(
    SELECT 
        'store' AS channel, 
        'ss_customer_sk' AS col_name, 
        d.d_year, 
        d.d_qoy, 
        i.i_category, 
        ss.ss_ext_sales_price AS ext_sales_price 
    FROM 
        store_sales ss
        JOIN date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        JOIN item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    WHERE 
        ss.ss_customer_sk IS NULL

    UNION ALL 

    SELECT 
        'web' AS channel, 
        'ws_promo_sk' AS col_name, 
        d.d_year, 
        d.d_qoy, 
        i.i_category, 
        ws.ws_ext_sales_price AS ext_sales_price 
    FROM 
        web_sales ws
        JOIN date_dim d ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        JOIN item i ON ws.ws_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    WHERE 
        ws.ws_promo_sk IS NULL

    UNION ALL 

    SELECT 
        'catalog' AS channel, 
        'cs_bill_customer_sk' AS col_name, 
        d.d_year, 
        d.d_qoy, 
        i.i_category, 
        cs.cs_ext_sales_price AS ext_sales_price 
    FROM 
        catalog_sales cs
        JOIN date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        JOIN item i ON cs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    WHERE 
        cs.cs_bill_customer_sk IS NULL
) foo 
GROUP BY 
    channel, 
    col_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    i_category 
ORDER BY 
    channel, 
    col_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    i_category 
LIMIT 100;
```

In this revised query, I have reordered the joins to ensure that the `date_dim` table, which is likely to be smaller or more selective due to the date filtering, is joined first. This might help in reducing the size of intermediate results early in the query execution. Additionally, I have maintained the use of explicit JOIN syntax and moved conditions to the ON clause where applicable, which can help in making better use of indexes.

If this still does not yield a performance improvement, it would be advisable to review the execution plans of both the original and optimized queries to identify specific bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Further tuning might involve adjusting indexes or even revisiting the database configuration settings.
