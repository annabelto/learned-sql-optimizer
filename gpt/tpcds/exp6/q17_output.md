To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_state,
    COUNT(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantitycount,
    AVG(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantityave,
    STDDEV_SAMP(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantitystdev,
    STDDEV_SAMP(ss_quantity) / AVG(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantitycov,
    COUNT(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantitycount,
    AVG(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantityave,
    STDDEV_SAMP(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantitystdev,
    STDDEV_SAMP(sr_return_quantity) / AVG(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantitycov,
    COUNT(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantitycount,
    AVG(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantityave,
    STDDEV_SAMP(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantitystdev,
    STDDEV_SAMP(cs_quantity) / AVG(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantitycov
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
WHERE 
    d1.d_quarter_name = '2001Q1'
    AND d2.d_quarter_name IN ('2001Q1', '2001Q2', '2001Q3')
    AND d3.d_quarter_name IN ('2001Q1', '2001Q2', '2001Q3')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_state
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_state
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:

- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax, specifying the join conditions using the ON keyword. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** I moved all relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause in the JOINs where possible. This helps in potentially reducing the dataset earlier in the execution plan, which can improve performance.
- Conditions that filter the result set globally remain in the WHERE clause.

This optimized query should perform better due to clearer join conditions and potentially more efficient execution plans generated by the database engine.
