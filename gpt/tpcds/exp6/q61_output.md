To achieve a performance improvement, I will focus on optimizing the query by simplifying the structure and ensuring that the joins and filters are applied in the most efficient manner possible. Given that the previous optimizations did not yield a performance gain, I will attempt a different approach, possibly simplifying the query and ensuring that it leverages indexes effectively.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    promotional_sales.promotions,
    all_sales.total,
    CAST(promotional_sales.promotions AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(all_sales.total AS DECIMAL(15,4)) * 100 AS promotion_ratio
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS promotions
        FROM 
            store_sales
            INNER JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
            INNER JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
            INNER JOIN item ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
            INNER JOIN promotion ON store_sales.ss_promo_sk = promotion.p_promo_sk
            INNER JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
            INNER JOIN customer_address ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
        WHERE 
            date_dim.d_year = 2000 AND 
            date_dim.d_moy = 12 AND 
            store.s_gmt_offset = -7 AND 
            item.i_category = 'Home' AND 
            (promotion.p_channel_dmail = 'Y' OR promotion.p_channel_email = 'Y' OR promotion.p_channel_tv = 'Y') AND 
            customer_address.ca_gmt_offset = -7
    ) AS promotional_sales,
    (
        SELECT 
            SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total
        FROM 
            store_sales
            INNER JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
            INNER JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
            INNER JOIN item ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
            INNER JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
            INNER JOIN customer_address ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
        WHERE 
            date_dim.d_year = 2000 AND 
            date_dim.d_moy = 12 AND 
            store.s_gmt_offset = -7 AND 
            item.i_category = 'Home' AND 
            customer_address.ca_gmt_offset = -7
    ) AS all_sales
ORDER BY 
    promotions, 
    total 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Simplified Subqueries**: The subqueries have been simplified to ensure that they are as lean as possible, focusing on necessary joins and conditions.
2. **Consistent Join Types**: All joins have been explicitly defined as INNER JOINs, which may help the query optimizer to better understand the intent of the query and optimize the execution plan accordingly.
3. **Filter Placement**: Filters are placed directly in the WHERE clause of each subquery to ensure that they are applied as early as possible, reducing the working dataset size early in the execution.

This version of the query aims to be more straightforward for the query optimizer to interpret and execute efficiently, potentially leading to performance improvements over the original query.
