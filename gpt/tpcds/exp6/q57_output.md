To optimize the given TPC-DS query, I will apply the provided data-independent rewrite rules in a logical sequence to improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query. The rules will be applied as follows:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

        SUM(cs.cs_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(cs.cs_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i.i_category, i.i_brand, cc.cc_name, d.d_year) AS avg_monthly_sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i.i_category, i.i_brand, cc.cc_name ORDER BY d.d_year, d.d_moy) AS rn
    FROM

SELECT 
    *

WHERE 
    d_year = 2001 AND 
    avg_monthly_sales > 0 AND 
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales 
        ELSE NULL 
    END > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    avg_monthly_sales
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that were logically part of the join (such as linking foreign keys) were moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the corresponding JOIN. This can help the query optimizer by reducing the dataset early during the join process rather than filtering after joins are completed.

These changes should make the query more maintainable and could potentially improve execution performance by making better use of indexes and join optimizations.
