To further optimize the query, we need to consider additional strategies that might help in reducing execution time. Given the previous attempts did not yield a performance improvement, we will focus on refining the query structure and ensuring optimal use of PostgreSQL's capabilities.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    s_store_name, 
    s_store_id, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Sunday' THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sun_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Monday' THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS mon_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Tuesday' THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS tue_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Wednesday' THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS wed_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Thursday' THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS thu_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Friday' THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS fri_sales, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Saturday' THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sat_sales 
FROM 
    store
JOIN 
    store_sales ON store.s_store_sk = store_sales.ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    store.s_gmt_offset = -5 
    AND date_dim.d_year = 2000 
GROUP BY 
    s_store_name, 
    s_store_id 
ORDER BY 
    s_store_name, 
    s_store_id, 
    sun_sales, 
    mon_sales, 
    tue_sales, 
    wed_sales, 
    thu_sales, 
    fri_sales, 
    sat_sales 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made

1. **Reverted Join Order**: The join order has been reverted to start with `store`, then `store_sales`, and finally `date_dim`. This order might be more efficient depending on the cardinality and indexing of the `store` table.
2. **Indexing Strategy**: It is crucial to ensure that there are efficient indexes on the columns used in the join conditions (`s_store_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, `d_date_sk`) and the filter conditions (`s_gmt_offset`, `d_year`). If these indexes are not present, they should be created as they can significantly impact performance.
3. **Filter Pushdown**: The filters on `s_gmt_offset` and `d_year` are kept in the WHERE clause to ensure they are applied as early as possible in the query execution plan.

This query assumes that starting the joins with the `store` table, which is directly filtered by `s_gmt_offset`, might reduce the number of rows early in the query execution. The effectiveness of this approach heavily depends on the distribution of data and the presence of appropriate indexes. If performance issues persist, further analysis with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` would be necessary to diagnose the specific bottlenecks.
