To further optimize the query, I will revisit the join conditions and indexing strategies, and ensure that the query is structured to take advantage of PostgreSQL's strengths in query planning and execution. I will also ensure that the query is using the most efficient joins and that the grouping and aggregation are optimized.

### Further Optimization Steps:

1. **Ensure efficient use of indexes**:
   - Ensure that columns used in JOINs, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses are indexed. This is crucial for performance but cannot be directly seen or modified in the query itself. It requires database administration work.

2. **Review join conditions and types**:
   - Ensure that the most selective filters are applied early in the query process to reduce the size of intermediate result sets.

3. **Re-examine the use of subqueries**:
   - Flatten subqueries if possible, to reduce complexity and possibly improve performance.

4. **Optimize aggregation and grouping**:
   - Ensure that the database can use indexes for grouping operations.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    ca_city,
    bought_city,
    ss_ticket_number,
    amt,
    profit
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            ss_ticket_number,
            ss_customer_sk,
            customer_address.ca_city AS bought_city,
            SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
            SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit
        FROM 
            store_sales
            JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
            JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
            JOIN household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
            JOIN customer_address ON store_sales.ss_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
        WHERE 
            (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 8 OR household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count = 0)
            AND date_dim.d_dow IN (6, 0)
            AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
            AND store.s_city IN ('Midway', 'Fairview')
        GROUP BY 
            ss_ticket_number,
            ss_customer_sk,
            customer_address.ca_city
    ) AS dn
    JOIN customer ON dn.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    JOIN customer_address AS current_addr ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = current_addr.ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    current_addr.ca_city <> bought_city
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    ca_city,
    bought_city,
    ss_ticket_number
LIMIT 100;
```

**Key Changes**:
- Ensured that the subquery is necessary and efficiently written, focusing on reducing the dataset as early as possible.
- Made sure that the grouping by `customer_address.ca_city` is explicitly stated, which might help in using indexes more effectively if they exist on `customer_address.ca_city`.
- The query structure is maintained to be clear and maintainable, with explicit JOINs and conditions moved to appropriate ON clauses.

**Note**: For further performance improvements, consider reviewing the execution plan of the query using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and adding or optimizing indexes based on the columns used in filtering and joining.
