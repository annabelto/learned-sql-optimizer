Given the feedback and the need for further optimization, I will reassess the query structure and focus on optimizing the join sequence and ensuring that the most selective filters are applied as early as possible. This approach aims to minimize the volume of data being processed in the later stages of the query.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    store_sales ON item.i_item_sk = store_sales.ss_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim dt ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = dt.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    item.i_manager_id = 1
    AND dt.d_year = 1998
    AND dt.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category
ORDER BY 
    total_sales DESC,
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Join Order Reevaluation**: The join order has been adjusted to start with the `item` table, which is filtered by `i_manager_id = 1`. This could potentially reduce the number of rows early if the `item` table has fewer rows matching this condition compared to the original starting table.

2. **Filter Placement**: Filters on `dt.d_year = 1998` and `dt.d_moy = 11` are maintained in the `WHERE` clause to ensure they are applied as soon as the relevant data from `date_dim` is joined. This helps in reducing the dataset size before performing the computationally expensive aggregation.

3. **Index Utilization**: This query assumes effective indexing on `item.i_item_sk`, `store_sales.ss_item_sk`, `store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk`, and `date_dim.d_date_sk`. Indexes on `item.i_manager_id`, `date_dim.d_year`, and `date_dim.d_moy` are also assumed to be in place to facilitate quick filtering.

4. **Execution Plan Review**: It is crucial to review the execution plan after running this query to ensure that the database is using indexes effectively and that the join order is optimal based on the actual data distribution and table sizes.

5. **Database Configuration**: Consider reviewing and tuning the database configuration, such as increasing available memory for joins and sorts if the execution plan indicates that these operations are spilling to disk.

This version of the query is structured to leverage selective filters early in the execution process and to use a join order that might better align with the data distribution across the tables involved. Testing and reviewing the execution plan will be essential to validate the performance improvements.
