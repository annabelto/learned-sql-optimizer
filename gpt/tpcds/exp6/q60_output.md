To ensure the output of the optimized query matches the original, I will revisit the query structure and ensure that all conditions and joins are correctly applied. I will also ensure that the logic of the original query is preserved while maintaining the optimization principles.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ss AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry')
      AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 10 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i_item_id
), 
cs AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON cs_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry')
      AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 10 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i_item_id
), 
ws AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry')
      AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 10 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT i_item_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM ss
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM cs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM ws
) AS tmp1
GROUP BY i_item_id
ORDER BY i_item_id, total_sales
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Corrected Subquery Usage**: Ensured that the subquery for filtering `i_item_id` based on the 'Jewelry' category is correctly used in the WHERE clause of each sales table subquery. This matches the original query's intent more closely.
- **Explicit Joins and Conditions**: Maintained explicit JOIN syntax and moved conditions related to the date and customer address directly into the WHERE clause of each sales table subquery, which is more aligned with the original query structure.
- **Grouping and Ordering**: Kept the grouping and ordering logic consistent with the original query to ensure the output matches.

This version of the query should now correctly replicate the logic of the original query while using explicit JOIN syntax and maintaining optimizations for better performance.
