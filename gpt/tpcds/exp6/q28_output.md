The provided query is a complex query involving multiple subqueries, each filtering and aggregating data from the `store_sales` table based on different conditions. The query does not involve any joins between different tables or subqueries, so many of the provided rewrite rules related to joins (such as using explicit join syntax, replacing implicit joins with explicit joins, etc.) are not applicable here.

However, we can still review the query for potential optimizations in terms of clarity and performance, even though the specific rules about joins do not apply. Here are some general optimization techniques that could be considered:

1. **Consolidate Range Conditions**: Simplify arithmetic expressions in the WHERE clause for better readability and potentially better use of indexes.
2. **Use Aliases for Clarity**: Ensure all subqueries are clearly aliased to improve readability.
3. **Limit Scope Early**: The `LIMIT` clause is already used effectively at the end of the query.

Given the structure of the original query and the nature of the operations (mainly aggregations filtered by different conditions), the most significant improvements would likely come from ensuring that indexes are effectively used and that the database's query planner can efficiently execute the subqueries. However, these aspects are more related to physical database design and configuration rather than query syntax rewriting.

In this optimized query, I've simplified the range conditions directly in the WHERE clauses for better readability and potentially more efficient index usage. The structure and logic of the query remain unchanged, as the focus is on aggregating data from the same table under different conditions.
