Apologies for the oversight in the previous response. Let's correct the optimized query by ensuring that all table references are properly defined and joined in the correct sequence.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT s.s_store_name, i.i_item_desc, sc.revenue, i.i_current_price, i.i_wholesale_cost, i.i_brand 
FROM store s
JOIN (
    SELECT ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue 
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1176 AND 1176+11 
    GROUP BY ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
) sc ON s.s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk
JOIN item i ON i.i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
JOIN (
    SELECT ss_store_sk, avg(revenue) as ave 
    FROM (
        SELECT ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue 
        FROM store_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1176 AND 1176+11 
        GROUP BY ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
    ) sa 
    GROUP BY ss_store_sk
) sb ON sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk AND sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave
ORDER BY s.s_store_name, i.i_item_desc 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Corrections and Explanation:
- **Corrected the sequence of joins:** The subquery `sc` was referenced before it was defined in the JOIN clause with the `item` table. I rearranged the joins to ensure that each table alias is defined before it is used.
- **Ensured all joins are explicit and conditions are moved to ON clauses:** This helps in better readability and potentially allows the database engine to optimize the joins more effectively.
- **Maintained the logical structure of the original query:** The subqueries `sc` and `sb` are used to compute aggregated sales data and are joined with the `store` and `item` tables based on store and item keys. The condition `sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave` is used to filter the results based on the computed average.

This revised query should execute without errors and provide the intended results efficiently.
