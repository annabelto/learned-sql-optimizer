To ensure the output of the optimized query matches exactly with the original query, I will carefully review and adjust the transformation steps to maintain the logical integrity and correctness of the original query. Let's focus on optimizing the query without altering the result set, ensuring that all conditions and joins are correctly applied as in the original.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_moy, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name) AS avg_monthly_sales
    FROM 
        item
        JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001
        AND (
            (i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('history', 'school-uniforms', 'audio'))
            OR (i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Shoes') AND i_class IN ('pants', 'tennis', 'womens'))
        )
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_moy
) AS tmp1
WHERE 
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_monthly_sales <> 0 THEN (ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales)
        ELSE NULL 
    END > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales DESC, 
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: I have used explicit JOIN syntax to clearly define the relationships between tables. This helps in understanding the query and ensures that the joins are processed correctly.
2. **Filtering Conditions**: The filtering conditions are kept within the WHERE clause to ensure that they are applied correctly after the joins. This maintains the logical flow of filtering after combining the necessary tables.
3. **Window Function**: The window function is used exactly as in the original query to ensure that the average monthly sales are calculated correctly over the specified partitions.
4. **Grouping and Aggregation**: The grouping is maintained as per the original query to ensure that the aggregation of sales is done correctly for each group.
5. **Result Filtering and Ordering**: The final filtering of results based on the calculated metric and the ordering of results are maintained to ensure that the output matches the original query's intent.

This revised query aims to optimize readability and maintain the integrity of the original query's logic, ensuring that the output remains consistent while potentially improving performance through clearer syntax and structure.
