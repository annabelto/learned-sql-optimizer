To further refine the optimization, I will focus on simplifying the query structure and ensuring that the joins and subqueries are handled in the most efficient manner possible. I will also ensure that the query is structured to potentially leverage PostgreSQL's query planner and execution capabilities effectively.

### Original Query:
```sql
select ca_zip, ca_city, sum(ws_sales_price)
from web_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim, item
where ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
and (substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
or i_item_id in (select i_item_id from item where i_item_sk in (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)))
and ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_qoy = 1
and d_year = 2000
group by ca_zip, ca_city
order by ca_zip, ca_city
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, ca_city, SUM(ws_sales_price)
FROM web_sales
JOIN customer ON ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2000
WHERE substr(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
      OR EXISTS (
          SELECT 1
          FROM item AS item_sub
          WHERE item_sub.i_item_id = item.i_item_id
          AND item_sub.i_item_sk IN (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)
      )
GROUP BY ca_zip, ca_city
ORDER BY ca_zip, ca_city
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Join Optimization**: The join conditions are kept clean and straightforward, with filtering conditions on `date_dim` moved into the join clause to reduce the dataset early in the query execution.
2. **Subquery Handling**: The subquery has been changed to an `EXISTS` clause, which is typically more efficient than an `IN` clause with a subquery. This change should help in cases where the subquery could be executed numerous times, reducing overall execution time.
3. **Filtering Strategy**: The filtering on `substr(ca_zip, 1, 5)` and the `EXISTS` clause are maintained in the `WHERE` clause to ensure clarity and potentially use indexes if available.

This revised query aims to optimize execution by simplifying the structure and ensuring efficient use of joins and subqueries. The use of `EXISTS` might particularly improve performance by reducing the number of times the subquery needs to be executed.
