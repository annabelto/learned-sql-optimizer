Given the performance equivalence between the original and the previously attempted optimized queries, it appears that the original query is already optimized for performance. However, I will attempt another slight modification to potentially improve readability and maintain performance, while ensuring logical equivalence.

### Original Query:
```sql
select sum(cs_ext_discount_amt) as "excess discount amount"
from catalog_sales, item, date_dim
where i_manufact_id = 722
  and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
  and d_date between '2001-03-09' and (cast('2001-03-09' as date) + 90)
  and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
  and cs_ext_discount_amt > (
    select 1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
    from catalog_sales, date_dim
    where cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
      and d_date between '2001-03-09' and (cast('2001-03-09' as date) + 90)
      and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
  )
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
WHERE i_manufact_id = 722
  AND d_date BETWEEN '2001-03-09' AND '2001-06-07'  -- Pre-computed date range
  AND cs_ext_discount_amt > (
    SELECT 1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt)
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE cs_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
      AND d_date BETWEEN '2001-03-09' AND '2001-06-07'  -- Pre-computed date range
  )
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax:** Maintained explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and to ensure proper use of indexes.
- **Pre-computed Date Range:** Used a pre-computed date range to avoid repeated casting and function calls, which can be costly and prevent the use of indexes.
- **Subquery Reference:** Ensured that the subquery correctly references `item.i_item_sk` from the outer query to maintain logical equivalence and ensure that the average is calculated for the correct items.
- **Limit Clause:** Retained the LIMIT clause as in the original query to ensure that only the required number of rows are processed.

These changes aim to maintain the output consistency with the original query while potentially enhancing performance by making better use of PostgreSQL's query execution strategies, particularly through the use of explicit joins and improved date handling.
