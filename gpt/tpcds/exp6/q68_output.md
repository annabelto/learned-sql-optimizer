To optimize the given TPC-DS query, I will apply the provided data-independent rewrite rules in a logical sequence to improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query. The rules I will use are:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    ca_city,
    bought_city,
    ss_ticket_number,
    extended_price,
    extended_tax,
    list_price
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        ca_city AS bought_city,
        SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS extended_price,
        SUM(ss_ext_list_price) AS list_price,
        SUM(ss_ext_tax) AS extended_tax
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
        JOIN household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON store_sales.ss_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
        AND (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 3 OR household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count = 4)
        AND date_dim.d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)
        AND store.s_city IN ('Fairview', 'Midway')
    GROUP BY 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        ss_addr_sk,
        ca_city
) dn
JOIN customer ON dn.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address current_addr ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = current_addr.ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    current_addr.ca_city <> bought_city
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    ss_ticket_number
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Explicit Join Syntax**: I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions**: I moved the conditions that link tables from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs.
3. **Conditions Moved to ON Clauses**: Conditions that are directly related to how tables are joined were moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause to clarify the join logic and potentially allow the optimizer to reduce the dataset earlier in the execution plan.
4. **Maintained Logical Grouping**: Conditions that are not directly related to joining tables but rather filter the data (such as date and demographic conditions) are kept in the WHERE clause of the subquery.

This rewritten query should be easier to read and maintain, and it might also benefit from performance improvements depending on the database's query optimizer.
