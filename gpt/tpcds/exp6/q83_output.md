To further optimize the query while ensuring that the output matches the original, I will focus on refining the join conditions and ensuring that the subqueries are efficiently integrated. Given the previous attempts, it's crucial to simplify the approach and ensure that the database engine can better utilize indexes and reduce the number of rows processed early in the query execution.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH relevant_weeks AS (
    SELECT d_week_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date IN ('2001-07-13', '2001-09-10', '2001-11-16')
),
filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_week_seq IN (SELECT d_week_seq FROM relevant_weeks)
),
sr_items AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_id AS item_id, 
        SUM(sr_return_quantity) AS sr_item_qty 
    FROM 
        store_returns
        JOIN item ON sr_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN filtered_dates ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY 
        i_item_id
), 
cr_items AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_id AS item_id, 
        SUM(cr_return_quantity) AS cr_item_qty 
    FROM 
        catalog_returns
        JOIN item ON cr_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN filtered_dates ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY 
        i_item_id
), 
wr_items AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_id AS item_id, 
        SUM(wr_return_quantity) AS wr_item_qty 
    FROM 
        web_returns
        JOIN item ON wr_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN filtered_dates ON wr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY 
        i_item_id
)
SELECT 
    sr_items.item_id,
    sr_item_qty,
    sr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS sr_dev,
    cr_item_qty,
    cr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS cr_dev,
    wr_item_qty,
    wr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS wr_dev,
    (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 AS average
FROM 
    sr_items
    JOIN cr_items ON sr_items.item_id = cr_items.item_id
    JOIN wr_items ON sr_items.item_id = wr_items.item_id
ORDER BY 
    sr_items.item_id, 
    sr_item_qty 
LIMIT 100;
```

In this version, I've simplified the subquery structure by creating a `relevant_weeks` CTE to capture the `d_week_seq` values directly from the specified dates, and a `filtered_dates` CTE to capture the `d_date_sk` values from these weeks. This should help in reducing the complexity of the subqueries and allow for more efficient joins by directly using the `d_date_sk` values in the main CTEs (`sr_items`, `cr_items`, `wr_items`). This approach aims to minimize the amount of data processed by focusing on the necessary date keys from the start, potentially improving the overall performance of the query.
