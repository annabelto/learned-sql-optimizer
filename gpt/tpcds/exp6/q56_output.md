I apologize for the confusion in previous responses. Let's address the optimization correctly this time by ensuring that the logical structure and output of the original query are maintained, while applying the rules correctly.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ss AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN item ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON store_sales.ss_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
    WHERE item.i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item WHERE i_color IN ('powder', 'orchid', 'pink'))
      AND date_dim.d_year = 2000
      AND date_dim.d_moy = 3
      AND customer_address.ca_gmt_offset = -6
    GROUP BY i_item_id
), cs AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN item ON catalog_sales.cs_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
    WHERE item.i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item WHERE i_color IN ('powder', 'orchid', 'pink'))
      AND date_dim.d_year = 2000
      AND date_dim.d_moy = 3
      AND customer_address.ca_gmt_offset = -6
    GROUP BY i_item_id
), ws AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN item ON web_sales.ws_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON web_sales.ws_bill_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
    WHERE item.i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item WHERE i_color IN ('powder', 'orchid', 'pink'))
      AND date_dim.d_year = 2000
      AND date_dim.d_moy = 3
      AND customer_address.ca_gmt_offset = -6
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT i_item_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT i_item_id, total_sales FROM ss
    UNION ALL
    SELECT i_item_id, total_sales FROM cs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT i_item_id, total_sales FROM ws
) AS tmp1
GROUP BY i_item_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax.
- **JOIN Conditions:** I moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs.
- **Subquery for Color Filtering:** The subquery used for filtering `i_item_id` based on colors ('powder', 'orchid', 'pink') is maintained in the WHERE clause, which is crucial for correct logical filtering.
- **Date and Address Conditions:** Conditions related to date and address are kept in the WHERE clause to ensure they apply after the joins, which is necessary for correct results.
- **Aggregation and Grouping:** The aggregation (SUM) and grouping (GROUP BY) are correctly maintained as per the original query to ensure the output matches.
- **Ordering and Limiting:** The final ordering by `total_sales` DESC and `i_item_id`, and the limit of 100 rows are correctly applied.

This revised query should now correctly reflect the logical structure of the original query while using modern SQL practices for clarity and potential performance improvements.
