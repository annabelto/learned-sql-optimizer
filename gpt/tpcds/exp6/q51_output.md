I apologize for the oversight in the previous responses. Let's address the issue by ensuring that the window functions are correctly applied and that the query is structured properly to avoid referencing window function results directly in the `WHERE` clause.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH web_v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        ws_item_sk AS item_sk, 
        d_date,
        SUM(ws_sales_price) AS daily_sales,
        SUM(SUM(ws_sales_price)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY ws_item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS cume_sales
    FROM 
        web_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1212 AND 1212 + 11 
        AND ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        ws_item_sk, d_date
), 
store_v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        ss_item_sk AS item_sk, 
        d_date,
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS daily_sales,
        SUM(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY ss_item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS cume_sales
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1212 AND 1212 + 11 
        AND ss_item_sk IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        ss_item_sk, d_date
),
combined_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) AS item_sk,
        COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) AS d_date,
        web.cume_sales AS web_sales,
        store.cume_sales AS store_sales
    FROM 
        web_v1 web
    FULL OUTER JOIN 
        store_v1 store ON web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date
),
cumulative_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        item_sk,
        d_date,
        web_sales,
        store_sales,
        MAX(web_sales) OVER (
            PARTITION BY item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS web_cumulative,
        MAX(store_sales) OVER (
            PARTITION BY item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS store_cumulative
    FROM 
        combined_sales
)
SELECT  
    item_sk,
    d_date,
    web_sales,
    store_sales,
    web_cumulative,
    store_cumulative
FROM 
    cumulative_sales
WHERE 
    web_cumulative > store_cumulative
ORDER BY 
    item_sk, d_date
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Cumulative Sales CTE**: This CTE computes the cumulative sales for both web and store sales. It also calculates the running maximum of these cumulative sales which is used for comparison.
- **Final Selection**: After computing the cumulative values in a CTE, the final `SELECT` statement filters based on these computed cumulative values and orders the results.

This approach ensures that the window functions are computed in a separate step before the filtering condition is applied, which resolves the error you encountered.
