To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    substr(w_warehouse_name, 1, 20) AS warehouse_name,
    sm_type,
    cc_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) AND (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) AND (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) AND (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    ship_mode ON cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk
JOIN 
    call_center ON cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11
GROUP BY 
    substr(w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm_type,
    cc_name
ORDER BY 
    substr(w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm_type,
    cc_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses of the JOINs. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that directly relate to the joining of tables are moved to the ON clause, which can help improve performance as the join conditions are evaluated earlier and might reduce the size of intermediate results.

This rewritten query should be functionally equivalent to the original but is clearer and potentially more efficient due to better use of joins.
