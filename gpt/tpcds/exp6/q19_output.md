To further refine the optimization, I will focus on ensuring that the joins are structured in a way that minimizes the intermediate result sets and that the most selective filters are applied early in the query execution process. Additionally, I will review the use of indexes and ensure that the query leverages them effectively.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
    i.i_brand AS brand, 
    i.i_manufact_id, 
    i.i_manufact, 
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price 
FROM 
    item i
JOIN 
    store_sales ss 
    ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d 
    ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    customer c 
    ON ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ca 
    ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    store s 
    ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_manager_id = 14 
    AND d.d_moy = 11 
    AND d.d_year = 2002 
    AND SUBSTR(ca.ca_zip, 1, 5) <> SUBSTR(s.s_zip, 1, 5)
GROUP BY 
    i.i_brand, 
    i.i_brand_id, 
    i.i_manufact_id, 
    i.i_manufact
ORDER BY 
    ext_price DESC, 
    i.i_brand, 
    i.i_brand_id, 
    i.i_manufact_id, 
    i.i_manufact
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Reverted to Original Join Order**: After several attempts to reorder the joins and apply filters differently, it appears that the original join order and filter placement might have been close to optimal. This version reverts to that structure while maintaining explicit JOIN syntax and conditions.
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax and Conditions**: Maintained the use of explicit JOIN syntax and conditions to ensure clarity and potentially better use of indexes.
- **Filter Placement**: Kept the filters on the `item` and `date_dim` tables in the WHERE clause, which is a common practice for non-linking conditions that are highly selective.

This version of the query aims to maintain the performance characteristics of the original query while ensuring that the SQL is clear and maintainable. The performance should ideally be very close to the original, if not slightly better, depending on the database's execution plan and the availability of indexes.
