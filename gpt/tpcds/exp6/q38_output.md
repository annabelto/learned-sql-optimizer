To further optimize the query, I will review the existing query structure and consider additional optimizations that might not have been fully leveraged in the previous attempt. This includes ensuring that the joins are as efficient as possible and that indexing and other database optimizations are considered. However, since I can't modify indexes or other database configurations in this format, I'll focus on optimizing the SQL query itself.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM store_sales
    INNER JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1200

    INTERSECT

    SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM catalog_sales
    INNER JOIN date_dim ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN customer ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1200

    INTERSECT

    SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM web_sales
    INNER JOIN date_dim ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN customer ON web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1200
) AS hot_cust
LIMIT 100;
```

### Additional Considerations:
1. **Index Utilization**: Ensure that indexes on `ss_sold_date_sk`, `cs_sold_date_sk`, `ws_sold_date_sk`, `d_date_sk`, `ss_customer_sk`, `cs_bill_customer_sk`, and `ws_bill_customer_sk` are properly set up in the database. This can significantly affect the performance of the joins.

2. **Query Plan Analysis**: Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze the query execution plan. This might provide insights into whether the database is using indexes effectively and whether any particular part of the query is causing performance issues.

3. **Materialized Views**: If the query is run frequently with the same parameters, consider using materialized views to store the result of the expensive `INTERSECT` operations.

4. **Partitioning**: If the tables involved are very large, table partitioning on columns like `d_date_sk` or based on date ranges could improve performance.

5. **Adjusting Query Logic**: If business requirements allow, consider if the `INTERSECT` operation is absolutely necessary or if it can be optimized or simplified.

The provided query is structurally optimized for clarity and potential performance, assuming proper indexing and database configuration. Further performance improvements would likely depend on specific database conditions and configurations.
