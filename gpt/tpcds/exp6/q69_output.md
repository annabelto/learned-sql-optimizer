To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    count(*) AS cnt1, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    count(*) AS cnt2, 
    cd_credit_rating, 
    count(*) AS cnt3 
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd ON cd.cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk
WHERE 
    ca.ca_state IN ('IL', 'TX', 'ME')
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT * 
        FROM 
            store_sales ss
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = ss.ss_customer_sk 
            AND d.d_year = 2002 
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT * 
        FROM 
            web_sales ws
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = ws.ws_bill_customer_sk 
            AND d.d_year = 2002 
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT * 
        FROM 
            catalog_sales cs
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = cs.cs_ship_customer_sk 
            AND d.d_year = 2002 
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
GROUP BY 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd_credit_rating 
ORDER BY 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd_credit_rating 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:

- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs. This makes the query easier to read and understand, and it also helps the database optimizer to better understand the relationships between the tables.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that were part of the WHERE clause and directly related to the join logic were moved to the ON clause of the corresponding JOIN. This can help improve performance by reducing the number of rows that need to be fetched and joined.
- **Subqueries:** The EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries were rewritten to use explicit JOINs instead of listing tables in the FROM clause, and conditions were moved to the ON clause where appropriate.

This optimized query should perform better due to clearer join semantics and potentially more efficient execution plans generated by the PostgreSQL query planner.
