To achieve a performance improvement, I will focus on refining the query further by optimizing the join order based on the selectivity of the conditions and ensuring that the most restrictive filters are applied as early as possible in the query execution. Additionally, I will ensure that the query is structured to potentially leverage any available indexes more effectively.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cs1.cs_order_number) AS "order count",
       SUM(cs1.cs_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
       SUM(cs1.cs_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM catalog_sales cs1
JOIN call_center cc ON cs1.cs_call_center_sk = cc.cc_call_center_sk
                     AND cc.cc_county = 'Williamson County'
JOIN customer_address ca ON cs1.cs_ship_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
                          AND ca.ca_state = 'PA'
JOIN date_dim d ON cs1.cs_ship_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
                AND d.d_date BETWEEN '2002-4-01' AND (CAST('2002-4-01' AS DATE) + 60)
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM catalog_returns cr1
      WHERE cs1.cs_order_number = cr1.cr_order_number
  )
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM catalog_sales cs2
      WHERE cs1.cs_order_number = cs2.cs_order_number
        AND cs1.cs_warehouse_sk <> cs2.cs_warehouse_sk
  )
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT cs1.cs_order_number)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Optimized Join Order:** The join order has been adjusted to start with the `call_center` table, filtering early on the `cc_county` condition, which is assumed to be highly selective. This should reduce the number of rows processed in subsequent joins.

2. **Selective Filtering Early:** By placing highly selective conditions early in the join sequence (such as `cc_county` and `ca_state`), the query minimizes the working dataset size early in the execution, which can lead to performance gains.

3. **Date Range Condition Placement:** The date range condition is placed in the join condition with the `date_dim` table to potentially leverage indexes on the `d_date_sk` and `d_date` columns more effectively.

4. **Subquery Optimization:** The EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries are maintained to ensure correctness but are placed in the WHERE clause to filter out rows after the primary dataset has been reduced by the join conditions.

This version of the query is designed to optimize performance by strategically ordering joins and applying filters to reduce the dataset size as early as possible in the query execution process. This should ideally result in a performance improvement over the original query.
