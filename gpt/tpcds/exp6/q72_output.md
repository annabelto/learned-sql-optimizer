To optimize the provided query, we will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

The original query already uses explicit join syntax and does not use comma-separated tables in the FROM clause, so rules 1 and 2 are not applicable here. The query also uses explicit join conditions (rule 5) and does not use WHERE for linking or combining tables (rules 3 and 4). Therefore, the main optimization we can apply here is rule 6, moving conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clause in JOINs where possible.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_desc,
    w_warehouse_name,
    d1.d_week_seq,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo,
    COUNT(*) AS total_cnt
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    inventory ON cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk
JOIN 
    warehouse ON w_warehouse_sk = inv_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk AND hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000'
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk AND d1.d_year = 1998
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    promotion ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    catalog_returns ON cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND cr_order_number = cs_order_number
WHERE 
    inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity
GROUP BY 
    i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq
ORDER BY 
    total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**
- Conditions related to `customer_demographics` and `household_demographics` are moved to the respective JOIN clauses.
- Conditions related to `date_dim` tables are moved to the respective JOIN clauses.
- The condition `inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity` remains in the WHERE clause as it involves columns from two different tables (`inventory` and `catalog_sales`) that are not directly joined to each other.

This restructuring helps in potentially reducing the number of rows processed in the joins before applying filters in the WHERE clause, which can improve the performance of the query.
