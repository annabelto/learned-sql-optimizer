To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Application of Rules:

1. **Replace comma-separated tables with explicit JOIN syntax**:
   - Convert the implicit joins in the main query and subqueries to explicit JOINs.
   
2. **Use explicit join conditions**:
   - Specify the join conditions using the ON keyword instead of the WHERE clause.

3. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs**:
   - Move relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause to make the join conditions explicit and clear.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS total_sum,
        s_state,
        s_county,
        grouping(s_state) + grouping(s_county) AS lochierarchy,
        rank() OVER (
            PARTITION BY grouping(s_state) + grouping(s_county), 
            CASE WHEN grouping(s_county) = 0 THEN s_state END 
            ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) DESC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
        JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231
        AND s_state IN (
            SELECT s_state
            FROM (
                SELECT 
                    s_state,
                    rank() OVER (
                        PARTITION BY s_state 
                        ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) DESC
                    ) AS ranking
                FROM 
                    store_sales
                    JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
                    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
                WHERE 
                    d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231
                GROUP BY s_state
            ) tmp1
            WHERE ranking <= 5
        )
    GROUP BY ROLLUP(s_state, s_county)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    lochierarchy DESC,
    CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN s_state END,
    rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit JOINs**: The query now uses explicit JOIN syntax (`JOIN ... ON ...`) instead of listing tables in the FROM clause separated by commas. This makes the relationships between tables clearer and is generally preferred for readability and maintainability.
- **Conditions moved to ON clause**: Conditions that directly relate to how the tables are joined have been moved to the ON clause of the JOINs. This can help improve performance by reducing the number of rows combined before filtering.
- **Subquery optimization**: The subquery used for filtering `s_state` is also rewritten using explicit JOINs and moving conditions to the ON clause.

This rewritten query should be more efficient and easier to understand and maintain.
