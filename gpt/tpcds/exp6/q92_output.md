To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query by using explicit join syntax and moving conditions to appropriate places. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select sum(ws_ext_discount_amt) as "Excess Discount Amount"
from web_sales, item, date_dim
where i_manufact_id = 714
and i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
and d_date between '2000-02-01' and (cast('2000-02-01' as date) + 90)
and d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
and ws_ext_discount_amt > (
    SELECT 1.3 * avg(ws_ext_discount_amt)
    FROM web_sales, date_dim
    WHERE ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
    and d_date between '2000-02-01' and (cast('2000-02-01' as date) + 90)
    and d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
)
order by sum(ws_ext_discount_amt)
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(ws.ws_ext_discount_amt) AS "Excess Discount Amount"
FROM web_sales ws
JOIN item i ON i.i_item_sk = ws.ws_item_sk
JOIN date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ws.ws_sold_date_sk
WHERE i.i_manufact_id = 714
AND d.d_date BETWEEN '2000-02-01' AND (CAST('2000-02-01' AS DATE) + 90)
AND ws.ws_ext_discount_amt > (
    SELECT 1.3 * AVG(ws_inner.ws_ext_discount_amt)
    FROM web_sales ws_inner
    JOIN date_dim d_inner ON d_inner.d_date_sk = ws_inner.ws_sold_date_sk
    WHERE ws_inner.ws_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    AND d_inner.d_date BETWEEN '2000-02-01' AND (CAST('2000-02-01' AS DATE) + 90)
)
ORDER BY SUM(ws.ws_ext_discount_amt)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs.
- **Explicit Join Conditions**: I moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs.
- **Subquery Join Condition**: In the subquery, I ensured that the join condition is explicitly stated and moved relevant filters to the ON clause where applicable.
- **Alias Usage**: I used table aliases (`ws`, `i`, `d`, `ws_inner`, `d_inner`) to make the query more readable and to clearly distinguish between the main query and subquery tables.

This rewritten query is more readable and maintains clear separation of join conditions and filtering conditions, which can help in understanding and maintaining the query. Additionally, explicit JOIN syntax is generally preferred for clarity and potential performance benefits in complex queries.
