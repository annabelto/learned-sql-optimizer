To achieve further optimization, I will focus on refining the join order based on the estimated size and selectivity of the tables involved, and ensure that the most restrictive conditions are applied as early as possible in the query execution. This approach aims to reduce the volume of data being processed in the early stages of the query, which can lead to performance improvements.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    ca_country, 
    ca_state, 
    ca_county, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_quantity AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg1, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_list_price AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg2, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_coupon_amt AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg3, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_sales_price AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg4, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_net_profit AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg5, 
    AVG(CAST(c_birth_year AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg6, 
    AVG(CAST(cd1.cd_dep_count AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg7 
FROM 
    date_dim d
JOIN 
    catalog_sales cs ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    item i ON cs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    customer c ON cs.cs_bill_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd1 ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd1.cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd2 ON c.c_current_cdemo_sk = cd2.cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    d.d_year = 2001 AND
    cd1.cd_gender = 'F' AND
    cd1.cd_education_status = 'Primary' AND
    c.c_birth_month IN (1,3,7,11,10,4) AND
    ca.ca_state IN ('AL','MO','TN','GA','MT','IN','CA')
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county)
ORDER BY 
    ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:

1. **Refined Join Order:** The join order has been adjusted to start with the `date_dim` table, which is filtered by year early in the query. This should help in reducing the dataset size right from the start.

2. **Centralized WHERE Clause Filters:** All major filters are applied in the WHERE clause immediately after defining the joins. This ensures that the filters are applied as soon as all necessary tables are joined, potentially reducing the processing load.

3. **Alias Usage:** Aliases are used consistently for all tables to make the query more readable and to ensure that the joins are clearly defined.

This optimized query is designed to leverage the selectivity of the `date_dim` and `customer_demographics` tables early in the join sequence, which can help in reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent joins. The performance improvement will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the database's ability to utilize indexes effectively.
