To further optimize the query, I will focus on ensuring that the join order and conditions are optimal, potentially leveraging statistics about the table sizes and distributions. Additionally, I will consider the use of indexes and whether certain conditions can be pushed down further to reduce the dataset size early in the execution plan.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, 
    AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, 
    AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, 
    AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM 
    date_dim
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN 
    item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    promotion ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
WHERE 
    d_year = 2002
    AND cd_gender = 'M' 
    AND cd_marital_status = 'W' 
    AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown' 
    AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id 
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Join Order Adjusted:** The `date_dim` table is joined first, assuming that filtering by `d_year = 2002` early might significantly reduce the number of rows processed. This is based on the assumption that `date_dim` has a good index on `d_date_sk` and `d_year`.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions:** All joins are explicitly defined with the `ON` clause to ensure clarity and potentially use indexes effectively.
3. **Filter Placement:** All filters remain in the `WHERE` clause. This maintains a clear separation between join conditions and additional filters, which might be beneficial depending on the database's query optimizer.

These adjustments are made with the assumption that reducing the dataset size early by using a highly selective filter (`d_year = 2002`) will improve performance. The effectiveness of these optimizations depends on the actual data distribution, index availability, and the database's ability to optimize query execution plans.
