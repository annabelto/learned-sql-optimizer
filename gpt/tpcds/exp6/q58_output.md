To further optimize the query, I will focus on improving the subquery execution and ensuring that the joins are as efficient as possible. I will also ensure that indexes, if available, are effectively utilized by the query planner. Here are the steps I will take:

1. **Materialize the subquery** used in the WHERE clause to avoid repeated execution.
2. **Use explicit JOIN conditions** to ensure clarity and potentially help the optimizer.
3. **Ensure that the JOIN order and conditions are optimal** for leveraging indexes.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH date_key AS (
    SELECT 
        d_date_sk, d_week_seq
    FROM 
        date_dim
    WHERE 
        d_date = '2001-06-16'
),
relevant_dates AS (
    SELECT 
        d_date_sk
    FROM 
        date_dim
    WHERE 
        d_week_seq = (SELECT d_week_seq FROM date_key)
),
ss_items AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_id AS item_id,
        SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ss_item_rev
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN relevant_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY 
        i_item_id
),
cs_items AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_id AS item_id,
        SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS cs_item_rev
    FROM 
        catalog_sales
        JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN relevant_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY 
        i_item_id
),
ws_items AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_id AS item_id,
        SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS ws_item_rev
    FROM 
        web_sales
        JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN relevant_dates ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY 
        i_item_id
)
SELECT 
    ss_items.item_id,
    ss_item_rev,
    ss_item_rev / ((ss_item_rev + cs_item_rev + ws_item_rev) / 3) * 100 AS ss_dev,
    cs_item_rev,
    cs_item_rev / ((ss_item_rev + cs_item_rev + ws_item_rev) / 3) * 100 AS cs_dev,
    ws_item_rev,
    ws_item_rev / ((ss_item_rev + cs_item_rev + ws_item_rev) / 3) * 100 AS ws_dev,
    (ss_item_rev + cs_item_rev + ws_item_rev) / 3 AS average
FROM 
    ss_items
    JOIN cs_items ON ss_items.item_id = cs_items.item_id
    JOIN ws_items ON ss_items.item_id = ws_items.item_id
WHERE 
    ss_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * cs_item_rev AND 1.1 * cs_item_rev
    AND ss_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ws_item_rev AND 1.1 * ws_item_rev
    AND cs_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ss_item_rev AND 1.1 * ss_item_rev
    AND cs_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ws_item_rev AND 1.1 * ws_item_rev
    AND ws_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ss_item_rev AND 1.1 * ss_item_rev
    AND ws_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * cs_item_rev AND 1.1 * cs_item_rev
ORDER BY 
    item_id, ss_item_rev
LIMIT 100;
```

This version of the query materializes the subquery results into a CTE (`relevant_dates`), which should help in reducing the execution time of the subquery. It also ensures that all joins are explicitly defined and conditions are placed appropriately to leverage indexes. This should provide a performance improvement over both the original and previously optimized queries.
