I apologize for the confusion in previous responses. Let's ensure the optimized query matches the output of the original query while applying the optimization rules correctly.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH inv AS (
    SELECT 
        w_warehouse_name,
        w_warehouse_sk,
        i_item_sk,
        d_moy,
        stddev_samp(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS stdev,
        avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS mean,
        CASE 
            WHEN avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) = 0 THEN NULL 
            ELSE stddev_samp(inv_quantity_on_hand) / avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) 
        END AS cov
    FROM 
        inventory
        JOIN item ON inventory.inv_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
        JOIN warehouse ON inventory.inv_warehouse_sk = warehouse.w_warehouse_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON inventory.inv_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        date_dim.d_year = 2000
    GROUP BY 
        w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy
    HAVING 
        CASE 
            WHEN avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) = 0 THEN 0 
            ELSE stddev_samp(inv_quantity_on_hand) / avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) 
        END > 1
)
SELECT 
    inv1.w_warehouse_sk,
    inv1.i_item_sk,
    inv1.d_moy,
    inv1.mean,
    inv1.cov,
    inv2.w_warehouse_sk,
    inv2.i_item_sk,
    inv2.d_moy,
    inv2.mean,
    inv2.cov
FROM 
    inv inv1
    JOIN inv inv2 ON inv1.i_item_sk = inv2.i_item_sk AND inv1.w_warehouse_sk = inv2.w_warehouse_sk
WHERE 
    inv1.d_moy = 1 AND inv2.d_moy = 2 AND inv1.cov > 1.5
ORDER BY 
    inv1.w_warehouse_sk,
    inv1.i_item_sk,
    inv1.d_moy,
    inv1.mean,
    inv1.cov,
    inv2.d_moy,
    inv2.mean,
    inv2.cov;
```

This query has been carefully revised to ensure it matches the logic and output of the original query while applying the optimization rules:

1. **Explicit Join Syntax**: Using explicit JOIN syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions**: Moving conditions that link tables from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs.
3. **Filter Conditions**: Keeping the filter conditions in the WHERE clause that do not directly relate to joining tables but are used to filter the result set.
4. **HAVING Clause**: Using the HAVING clause to filter groups by the calculated condition, which is more appropriate for conditions that involve aggregate functions.

This corrected and optimized query should now correctly reflect the logic of the original query while adhering to best practices for SQL query writing.
