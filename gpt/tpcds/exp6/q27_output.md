To further optimize the query for better performance, I will focus on ensuring that the query is structured to take full advantage of indexes, and I will also review the join conditions and filters to ensure they are optimal. Additionally, I will ensure that the query is not just syntactically correct but also optimized for execution plans that databases like PostgreSQL might generate.

### Original Query:
```sql
select i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) g_state, avg(ss_quantity) agg1, avg(ss_list_price) agg2, avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3, avg(ss_sales_price) agg4 
from store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, store, item 
where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
  and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
  and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk 
  and ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk 
  and cd_gender = 'M' 
  and cd_marital_status = 'W' 
  and cd_education_status = 'Secondary' 
  and d_year = 1999 
  and s_state in ('TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN') 
group by rollup (i_item_id, s_state) 
order by i_item_id, s_state 
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) AS g_state, 
       AVG(ss_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(ss_list_price) AS agg2, 
       AVG(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(ss_sales_price) AS agg4
FROM store_sales
JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
WHERE cd_gender = 'M' 
  AND cd_marital_status = 'W' 
  AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary' 
  AND d_year = 1999 
  AND s_state = 'TN'
GROUP BY ROLLUP (i_item_id, s_state)
ORDER BY i_item_id, s_state
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Join Order:** Adjusted the order of joins to potentially better utilize indexes. Typically, the `item` and `store` tables might be smaller or more frequently accessed, so joining them earlier might help, depending on the database statistics and index availability.
2. **Filter Simplification:** Continued to use the simplified filter for `s_state` to 'TN' directly in the WHERE clause, which avoids unnecessary processing of multiple identical values.
3. **Index Utilization:** The query assumes that there are appropriate indexes on the join and filter columns (`ss_item_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, `ss_cdemo_sk`, `cd_gender`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, `d_year`, `s_state`). If not already present, consider adding indexes, especially composite indexes that match the join and filtering patterns.

### Additional Recommendations:
- **Analyze and Vacuum:** Regularly run ANALYZE (and VACUUM if needed) on the tables to ensure statistics are up to date, which helps the PostgreSQL query planner to make better decisions.
- **Examine Execution Plan:** Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check the execution plan of both the original and optimized queries to understand where the differences lie and if further tuning is necessary.
