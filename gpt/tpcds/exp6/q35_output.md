To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replaced comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs.
- **Explicit Join Conditions**: Moved join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs.
- **Subquery Joins**: Updated subqueries to use explicit JOINs between `store_sales`, `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `date_dim`.
- **Condition Movement**: Moved conditions related to `d_year` and `d_qoy` into the ON clauses of the respective subquery JOINs where applicable.

These changes should make the query more readable and potentially improve performance by allowing the database engine to better optimize the execution plan.
