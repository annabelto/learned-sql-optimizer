To further optimize the query, we need to consider the possibility that the original query structure might be more aligned with the database's internal optimizations or indexing strategies. Given the slight performance difference, it's possible that the original query's structure is already quite efficient due to specific database configurations or the nature of the data distribution.

However, let's attempt another slight modification to see if we can achieve better performance by simplifying the query and ensuring that the joins and conditions are as streamlined as possible.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    item.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM 
    date_dim dt
JOIN 
    store_sales ON dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    item ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
WHERE 
    item.i_manager_id = 1
    AND dt.d_moy = 12
    AND dt.d_year = 2000
GROUP BY 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_brand,
    item.i_brand_id
ORDER BY 
    dt.d_year,
    ext_price DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Reverted to a simpler join condition:** The join conditions are kept straightforward and similar to the original query, with the filtering conditions placed in the WHERE clause. This approach might be more aligned with how the database optimizes query execution, especially if there are indexes on the columns used in the WHERE clause (`i_manager_id`, `d_moy`, `d_year`).

2. **Maintained explicit JOIN syntax:** The explicit JOIN syntax is preserved for clarity and to ensure that the SQL engine optimally uses indexes during the join operations.

3. **Grouping and ordering:** No changes were made to the grouping and ordering clauses as they are essential for the query's requirements and likely optimized by the database.

This version of the query maintains a balance between explicit join conditions and a streamlined WHERE clause, which might help in achieving better performance depending on the database's internal handling of such structures. If this still does not improve performance, it would be advisable to review the execution plan and consider physical database aspects like indexing or even query caching mechanisms.
