To optimize the given TPC-DS query, I will apply the provided data-independent rewrite rules in a logical sequence to improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag, ss_ticket_number, cnt 
from (
    select ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, count(*) cnt 
    from store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics 
    where store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk 
      and store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk 
      and store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk 
      and (date_dim.d_dom between 1 and 3 or date_dim.d_dom between 25 and 28) 
      and (household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' or household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '0-500') 
      and household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 
      and (case when household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 then household_demographics.hd_dep_count / household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count else null end) > 1.2 
      and date_dim.d_year in (2000, 2001, 2002) 
      and store.s_county in ('Williamson County') 
    group by ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk
) dn, customer 
where ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk 
  and cnt between 15 and 20 
order by c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag desc, ss_ticket_number;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag, ss_ticket_number, cnt 
FROM (
    SELECT ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, COUNT(*) AS cnt 
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
    JOIN household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    WHERE (date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 3 OR date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 25 AND 28)
      AND (household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' OR household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '0-500')
      AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0
      AND (CASE WHEN household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 THEN household_demographics.hd_dep_count / household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count ELSE NULL END) > 1.2
      AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
      AND store.s_county = 'Williamson County'
    GROUP BY ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk
) dn
JOIN customer ON dn.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
WHERE cnt BETWEEN 15 AND 20
ORDER BY c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag DESC, ss_ticket_number;
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1-4**: I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs.
- **Step 5**: I ensured that all join conditions are explicitly stated in the ON clauses.
- **Step 6**: I moved relevant filtering conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause where appropriate, although in this case, most conditions were more logically placed in the WHERE clause due to their nature (filtering post-join rather than necessary for the join).

This rewritten query should be easier to read and maintain, and it might also benefit from performance improvements due to clearer separation of join conditions and filters.
