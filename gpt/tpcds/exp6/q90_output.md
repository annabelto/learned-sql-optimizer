Given the consistent performance results, it appears that the original query is already highly optimized for the given database schema and indexing strategy. However, I will attempt one more subtle optimization by ensuring that all conditions are placed optimally and that the query is as streamlined as possible.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    CAST(amc AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(pmc AS DECIMAL(15,4)) AS am_pm_ratio 
FROM 
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS amc 
        FROM web_sales
        JOIN time_dim ON ws_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk
        JOIN household_demographics ON ws_ship_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
        JOIN web_page ON ws_web_page_sk = web_page.wp_web_page_sk
        WHERE time_dim.t_hour BETWEEN 12 AND 13
          AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 6
          AND web_page.wp_char_count BETWEEN 5000 AND 5200
    ) AS at,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS pmc 
        FROM web_sales
        JOIN time_dim ON ws_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk
        JOIN household_demographics ON ws_ship_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
        JOIN web_page ON ws_web_page_sk = web_page.wp_web_page_sk
        WHERE time_dim.t_hour BETWEEN 14 AND 15
          AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 6
          AND web_page.wp_char_count BETWEEN 5000 AND 5200
    ) AS pt
ORDER BY am_pm_ratio 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:
- **Streamlined Join Conditions**: The join conditions are kept within the `ON` clauses where appropriate, and additional filtering conditions are maintained in the `WHERE` clause to ensure clarity and optimal use of indexes.
- **Consistency and Clarity**: The query maintains a consistent structure, which can help in understanding and maintaining the query over time. It also ensures that the database optimizer can effectively use the available indexes.

This version of the query aims to maintain the performance while ensuring that the query is as clear and maintainable as possible. The performance should ideally be very close to the original query, assuming proper indexing and database configuration. This approach focuses on clarity and effective use of SQL constructs without introducing additional complexity that could hinder performance.
