Apologies for the confusion in the previous response. Let's correct the optimized query by ensuring proper syntax and structure. The error you encountered is likely due to improper handling of subqueries and joins. Here's the corrected version:

This query uses explicit JOINs and CROSS JOINs between subqueries, as each subquery is independent and calculates a count for a specific time range. The CROSS JOIN is used because there is no direct relation between the subqueries, and we want a Cartesian product of their results. Each subquery uses explicit JOIN conditions and filters directly related to its specific time and conditions.
