I apologize for the repeated issues. Let's carefully review and ensure that the optimized query matches the output of the original query exactly, while applying the correct optimization techniques.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
    SELECT 
        wr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
        ca_state AS ctr_state,
        SUM(wr_return_amt) AS ctr_total_return
    FROM 
        web_returns
        JOIN date_dim ON wr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON wr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2000
    GROUP BY 
        wr_returning_customer_sk, ca_state
)
SELECT 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    c_preferred_cust_flag,
    c_birth_day,
    c_birth_month,
    c_birth_year,
    c_birth_country,
    c_login,
    c_email_address,
    c_last_review_date_sk AS c_last_review_date,
    ctr_total_return
FROM 
    customer_total_return ctr1
    JOIN customer ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk AND ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk AND ca_state = 'AR'
WHERE 
    ctr_total_return > (
        SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
        FROM customer_total_return ctr2
        WHERE ctr1.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state
    )
ORDER BY 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    c_preferred_cust_flag,
    c_birth_day,
    c_birth_month,
    c_birth_year,
    c_birth_country,
    c_login,
    c_email_address,
    c_last_review_date,
    ctr_total_return
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Corrections and Clarifications

1. **Correct Join Conditions**: The join between `customer_total_return` and `customer` is now correctly based on `ctr_customer_sk` matching `c_customer_sk`. The join with `customer_address` ensures that the address key and state match, aligning with the original query's logic.

2. **Alias for `c_last_review_date_sk`**: The alias `c_last_review_date` is used to match the expected output column name from the original query.

3. **Maintaining Logical Structure**: The WHERE clause and subquery for calculating the threshold of `ctr_total_return` are maintained as in the original query to ensure the logic remains consistent.

This revised query should now correctly reflect the output structure of the original query while incorporating the necessary optimizations for better performance and readability.
