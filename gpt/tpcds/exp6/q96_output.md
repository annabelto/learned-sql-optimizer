To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select count(*) 
from store_sales, household_demographics, time_dim, store 
where ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk 
  and ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk 
  and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk 
  and time_dim.t_hour = 8 
  and time_dim.t_minute >= 30 
  and household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 0 
  and store.s_store_name = 'ese' 
order by count(*) 
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM store_sales
JOIN time_dim ON ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk AND time_dim.t_hour = 8 AND time_dim.t_minute >= 30
JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 0
JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk AND store.s_store_name = 'ese'
ORDER BY COUNT(*)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Explicit Join Syntax:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions:** I moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses of each JOIN.
3. **Filter Conditions Moved:** Conditions that were filtering data (such as `time_dim.t_hour = 8`, `time_dim.t_minute >= 30`, `household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 0`, and `store.s_store_name = 'ese'`) were moved to the respective ON clauses. This can help the database optimize the join process by reducing the number of rows that need to be joined.
4. **Order and Limit:** The ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses remain unchanged as they are already optimized for the intended query purpose.

This restructuring should help in improving the performance of the query by making better use of indexes and reducing the number of rows processed during the joins.
