Given the consistent performance results between the original and all previously attempted optimized queries, it appears that the original query is already quite efficient. However, let's attempt one more optimization with a focus on ensuring the most efficient use of joins and conditions, and minimal changes to the structure, while also considering the possibility of leveraging any database-specific features or configurations that might not have been fully utilized in previous attempts.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
FROM item
JOIN inventory ON inventory.inv_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON date_dim.d_date_sk = inventory.inv_date_sk
JOIN store_sales ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
WHERE item.i_current_price BETWEEN 58 AND 88
AND item.i_manufact_id IN (259, 559, 580, 485)
AND inventory.inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
AND date_dim.d_date BETWEEN CAST('2001-01-13' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2001-01-13' AS DATE) + 60)
GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
ORDER BY i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Changes and Rationale:
1. **Explicit JOIN Conditions**: Maintains explicit JOIN conditions without embedding additional filters in the JOIN clauses, which might allow the database optimizer to better utilize indexes and optimize table scans.

2. **Filter Placement**: Filters are placed in the WHERE clause, which might be more traditional but could potentially allow for better optimization depending on how the database's query planner interprets and executes the SQL.

3. **Index Utilization**: This query assumes that there are effective indexes on the join keys (`i_item_sk`, `inv_item_sk`, `d_date_sk`, `ss_item_sk`) and the columns used in the WHERE clause (`i_current_price`, `i_manufact_id`, `inv_quantity_on_hand`, `d_date`). Proper indexing is crucial for performance, especially in large datasets.

4. **Execution Plan Review**: It remains critical to review the execution plan for this query. The plan will provide insights into how the database is interpreting and executing the SQL, which can guide further refinements.

This version of the query is designed to be straightforward, leveraging explicit joins and clear WHERE clause conditions, with the hope that it aligns well with the database's optimization capabilities. If this still does not improve performance, it would be advisable to delve deeper into database-specific tuning, possibly involving adjustments to configuration settings, further indexing strategies, or even hardware considerations if the dataset is particularly large or complex.
