To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select  * 
from (
    select i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, sumsales, 
           rank() over (partition by i_category order by sumsales desc) rk 
    from (
        select i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, 
               sum(coalesce(ss_sales_price*ss_quantity,0)) sumsales 
        from store_sales, date_dim, store, item 
        where ss_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk 
          and ss_item_sk=i_item_sk 
          and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk 
          and d_month_seq between 1217 and 1217+11 
        group by rollup(i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id)
    ) dw1
) dw2 
where rk <= 100 
order by i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, sumsales, rk 
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
select  * 
from (
    select i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, sumsales, 
           rank() over (partition by i_category order by sumsales desc) rk 
    from (
        select i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, 
               sum(coalesce(ss_sales_price*ss_quantity,0)) sumsales 
        from store_sales
        join date_dim on ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        join store on ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        join item on ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        where d_month_seq between 1217 and 1217+11 
        group by rollup(i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id)
    ) dw1
) dw2 
where rk <= 100 
order by i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, sumsales, rk 
limit 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables with explicit `JOIN` syntax and moved the join conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the respective `ON` clauses of each join. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** The conditions linking the tables were already moved to the `ON` clauses in the joins. The filter on `d_month_seq` remains in the `WHERE` clause as it is a filter post-join, not a join condition.

This optimized query should be more readable and maintainable, adhering to best practices for SQL queries.
