To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Application of Rules:

1. **Replace comma-separated tables with explicit JOIN syntax**:
   - Replace the implicit joins (comma-separated tables) with explicit JOINs.
   
2. **Use explicit join conditions**:
   - Specify the join conditions using the ON keyword instead of using the WHERE clause for joining tables.

3. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs**:
   - Move relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause to make the join conditions explicit and potentially allow the optimizer to reduce the dataset earlier in the execution plan.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
    i.i_brand AS brand,
    t.t_hour,
    t.t_minute, 
    SUM(tmp.ext_price) AS ext_price 
FROM 
    item i
JOIN 
    (SELECT 
         ws.ws_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, 
         ws.ws_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, 
         ws.ws_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, 
         ws.ws_sold_time_sk AS time_sk 
     FROM 
         web_sales ws
     JOIN 
         date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ws.ws_sold_date_sk
     WHERE 
         d.d_moy = 12 AND d.d_year = 2002
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT 
         cs.cs_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, 
         cs.cs_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, 
         cs.cs_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, 
         cs.cs_sold_time_sk AS time_sk 
     FROM 
         catalog_sales cs
     JOIN 
         date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = cs.cs_sold_date_sk
     WHERE 
         d.d_moy = 12 AND d.d_year = 2002
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT 
         ss.ss_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, 
         ss.ss_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, 
         ss.ss_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, 
         ss.ss_sold_time_sk AS time_sk 
     FROM 
         store_sales ss
     JOIN 
         date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
     WHERE 
         d.d_moy = 12 AND d.d_year = 2002
    ) tmp ON tmp.sold_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    time_dim t ON tmp.time_sk = t.t_time_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_manager_id = 1 
    AND (t.t_meal_time = 'breakfast' OR t.t_meal_time = 'dinner')
GROUP BY 
    i.i_brand, 
    i.i_brand_id,
    t.t_hour,
    t.t_minute 
ORDER BY 
    ext_price DESC, 
    i.i_brand_id;
```

This optimized query uses explicit JOIN syntax and moves conditions into the ON clause where appropriate, which can help in improving the performance by reducing the number of rows processed in the joins before applying filters in the WHERE clause.
