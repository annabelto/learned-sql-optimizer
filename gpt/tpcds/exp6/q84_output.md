To further optimize the query, I will focus on ensuring that the most restrictive conditions are applied as early as possible and that the joins are structured in a way that minimizes the size of intermediate datasets. Additionally, I will check if indexes are being effectively used, especially on join and filter columns.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    c_customer_id AS customer_id, 
    COALESCE(c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name, '') AS customername 
FROM 
    customer
JOIN 
    customer_address ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON customer.c_current_cdemo_sk = customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON customer.c_current_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    income_band ON household_demographics.hd_income_band_sk = income_band.ib_income_band_sk
JOIN 
    store_returns ON customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk = store_returns.sr_cdemo_sk
WHERE 
    customer_address.ca_city = 'Woodland' 
    AND income_band.ib_lower_bound >= 60306 
    AND income_band.ib_upper_bound <= 60306 + 50000
ORDER BY 
    customer.c_customer_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:
- **Explicit Table References:** I've added explicit table references to ensure that there is no ambiguity about which columns are being used, which can help in understanding and maintaining the query.
- **Join Order:** The join order has been adjusted to start with the `customer` table and then proceed to tables that are directly related through foreign key relationships. This structure is intended to use the indexed keys effectively.
- **Filter Placement:** Filters on `ca_city`, `ib_lower_bound`, and `ib_upper_bound` are placed in the WHERE clause to reduce the number of rows early in the query processing.

This version of the query aims to optimize performance by structuring joins and filters in a way that leverages database indexes and reduces the computational load by minimizing the size of data being processed at each step.
