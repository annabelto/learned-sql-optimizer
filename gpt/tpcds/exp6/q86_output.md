Given the consistent performance metrics between the original and the optimized queries, it appears that the original query is already quite efficient. However, I will attempt another approach to optimize the query, focusing on potential improvements in the execution plan and ensuring optimal use of PostgreSQL's capabilities.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ws_net_paid) AS total_sum,
        i_category,
        i_class,
        grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class) AS lochierarchy,
        rank() OVER (
            PARTITION BY grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class),
            CASE WHEN grouping(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END
            ORDER BY SUM(ws_net_paid) DESC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        web_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
    JOIN 
        item ON i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
    WHERE 
        d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1186 AND 1197
    GROUP BY 
        ROLLUP(i_category, i_class)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    lochierarchy DESC, 
    CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END, 
    rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Adjustments and Considerations:
1. **Maintain Explicit Joins**: The joins are explicitly defined, which is a best practice for clarity and potentially helps the optimizer.

2. **Filter Placement**: The filter on `d1.d_month_seq` is placed in the `WHERE` clause, which is standard for filtering after joins. This ensures that all necessary rows are considered during the join before applying the filter.

3. **Index Utilization**: Ensure that the following indexes are in place:
   - **`date_dim(d_date_sk, d_month_seq)`**: A composite index to quickly filter and join on date dimensions.
   - **`web_sales(ws_sold_date_sk, ws_item_sk, ws_net_paid)`**: A composite index to support the join and aggregation operations efficiently.
   - **`item(i_item_sk)`**: An index to support the join operation.

4. **Execution Plan Analysis**: It's crucial to use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check how PostgreSQL executes this query. Look for any potential bottlenecks like unnecessary sequential scans or inefficient join operations.

5. **Statistics and System Configuration**: Ensure that the statistics for the database are up to date using `ANALYZE` on the tables involved. Also, review PostgreSQL configuration settings such as `work_mem`, `shared_buffers`, and `effective_cache_size` to ensure they are optimized for the workload.

6. **Query Simplification**: The query structure is kept straightforward to avoid unnecessary complexity that might hinder the optimizer.

This approach aims to refine the query execution by ensuring optimal use of indexes, efficient execution plans, and maintaining best practices in SQL writing. This should ideally lead to a performance improvement, or at the very least, maintain the current level of performance with a cleaner and potentially more maintainable query structure.
