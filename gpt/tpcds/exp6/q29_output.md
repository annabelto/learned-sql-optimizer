To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name,
    MAX(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantity,
    MAX(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantity,
    MAX(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantity
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk
    AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
    AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk
    AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
WHERE 
    d1.d_moy = 4 
    AND d1.d_year = 1998
    AND d2.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 4 + 3
    AND d2.d_year = 1998
    AND d3.d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Explicit Join Syntax**: I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions**: I moved the conditions that link the tables from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses in the JOINs. This makes the query easier to understand and often helps the database optimizer to create a more efficient execution plan.
3. **Filter Conditions**: Conditions that do not serve as join conditions remain in the WHERE clause.
4. **Date Conditions**: I kept the date-related conditions in the WHERE clause as they filter the result set rather than serve as join conditions.

This optimized query should be more readable and potentially perform better due to clearer separation of joining conditions and filtering conditions.
