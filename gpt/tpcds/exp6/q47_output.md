To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we will apply the provided data-independent rewrite rules. The query involves multiple common table expressions (CTEs) and joins, which can be optimized for better readability and potentially improved execution plans by the query optimizer. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

    CASE 
        WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales

```

This optimized query uses explicit JOIN syntax and moves conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause in JOINs where applicable. This should help in maintaining clarity and potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to optimize join operations more effectively.
