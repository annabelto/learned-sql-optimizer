Apologies for the oversight in the previous query. Let's correct the join condition by ensuring that the correct column names are used for joining the tables. Here is the corrected optimized query:

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
    SELECT 
        cr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
        ca_state AS ctr_state,
        SUM(cr_return_amt_inc_tax) AS ctr_total_return
    FROM 
        catalog_returns
        JOIN date_dim ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON cr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001
    GROUP BY 
        cr_returning_customer_sk, ca_state
)
SELECT 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    ca_street_number,
    ca_street_name,
    ca_street_type,
    ca_suite_number,
    ca_city,
    ca_county,
    ca_state,
    ca_zip,
    ca_country,
    ca_gmt_offset,
    ca_location_type,
    ctr_total_return
FROM 
    customer_total_return ctr1
    JOIN customer ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
WHERE 
    ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
        SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
        FROM customer_total_return ctr2
        WHERE ctr1.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state
    )
    AND ca_state = 'TN'
ORDER BY 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    ca_street_number,
    ca_street_name,
    ca_street_type,
    ca_suite_number,
    ca_city,
    ca_county,
    ca_state,
    ca_zip,
    ca_country,
    ca_gmt_offset,
    ca_location_type,
    ctr_total_return
LIMIT 100;
```

### Corrections Made:
- **Correct Join Condition**: The join condition between `customer` and `customer_address` has been corrected to use `c_current_addr_sk` which is assumed to be the correct column in the `customer` table linking to the `customer_address` table. This was previously incorrectly referenced due to a typographical error.

This query should now execute without errors, assuming the schema definitions provided are correct and `c_current_addr_sk` exists in the `customer` table as a column linking to `customer_address`.
