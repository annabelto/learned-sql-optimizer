I apologize for the previous errors and the confusion caused. Let's ensure the optimized query matches the output of the original query exactly, while still applying best practices for SQL query writing.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT asceding.rnk, i1.i_product_name AS best_performing, i2.i_product_name AS worst_performing
FROM
    (SELECT item_sk, rnk
     FROM (SELECT item_sk, rank() OVER (ORDER BY rank_col ASC) AS rnk
           FROM (SELECT ss_item_sk AS item_sk, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS rank_col
                 FROM store_sales
                 WHERE ss_store_sk = 4
                 GROUP BY ss_item_sk
                 HAVING AVG(ss_net_profit) > 0.9 * (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit)
                                                   FROM store_sales
                                                   WHERE ss_store_sk = 4 AND ss_hdemo_sk IS NULL
                                                   GROUP BY ss_store_sk)
                ) AS subquery1
          ) AS ranked
     WHERE rnk < 11
    ) AS asceding
JOIN
    (SELECT item_sk, rnk
     FROM (SELECT item_sk, rank() OVER (ORDER BY rank_col DESC) AS rnk
           FROM (SELECT ss_item_sk AS item_sk, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS rank_col
                 FROM store_sales
                 WHERE ss_store_sk = 4
                 GROUP BY ss_item_sk
                 HAVING AVG(ss_net_profit) > 0.9 * (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit)
                                                   FROM store_sales
                                                   WHERE ss_store_sk = 4 AND ss_hdemo_sk IS NULL
                                                   GROUP BY ss_store_sk)
                ) AS subquery2
          ) AS ranked
     WHERE rnk < 11
    ) AS descending
ON asceding.rnk = descending.rnk
JOIN item i1 ON i1.i_item_sk = asceding.item_sk
JOIN item i2 ON i2.i_item_sk = descending.item_sk
ORDER BY asceding.rnk
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Adjustments and Explanation
1. **Correct Ranking and Filtering**: The ranking is computed within each subquery for both ascending and descending order based on `rank_col`. The filtering for `rnk < 11` is correctly placed within the subqueries after the ranking is computed, ensuring that only the top 10 ranks are considered for each subquery before they are joined.
2. **Join Conditions**: The join condition now correctly matches only the rank between the `asceding` and `descending` subqueries, ensuring that the items compared are correctly aligned by their rank.
3. **Explicit Join Conditions**: The joins between the item tables (`i1` and `i2`) and the subqueries (`asceding` and `descending`) are explicitly based on the item keys, ensuring the correct items are matched with their respective ranks.

This query should now correctly replicate the logic of the original query while using explicit JOIN syntax and ensuring that performance considerations are addressed by correctly scoping the window functions and joins.
