Apologies for the oversight. Let's correct the optimization while ensuring the output remains consistent with the original query. I will maintain the structure and logic of the original query while applying the rewrite rules effectively.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, 
       COUNT(*) AS cnt 
FROM customer_address a
JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
JOIN store_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
JOIN date_dim d ON s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
WHERE d.d_month_seq = (
    SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq 
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
) 
AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (
    SELECT AVG(j.i_current_price) 
    FROM item j 
    WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category
)
GROUP BY a.ca_state 
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state 
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables with explicit JOINs using the `ON` clause to specify join conditions.
- **Conditions Moved to JOINs Where Appropriate:** The conditions that directly relate to joining tables have been moved to the `ON` clauses. However, the conditions involving subqueries and specific business logic are kept in the `WHERE` clause to ensure the output matches the original query.
- **Subquery in WHERE Clause:** The subquery conditions are retained in the `WHERE` clause because they are dependent on the values of the outer query (`i.i_category` in the subquery for average price calculation). This ensures that the logic of calculating the price based on category-specific averages is correctly applied.

This revised query should now produce the same results as the original while adhering to best practices for SQL query writing.
