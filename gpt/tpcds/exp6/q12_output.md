To further optimize the query for performance, we need to consider additional aspects such as indexing, query plan, and the specific execution environment. However, since I can't analyze the actual database schema, indexes, or execution plans, I'll focus on refining the SQL query with general best practices that could potentially improve performance.

### Further Optimization Techniques:
1. **Ensure appropriate indexing**: Indexes on join and filter columns (`ws_item_sk`, `i_item_sk`, `ws_sold_date_sk`, `d_date_sk`, and `i_category`) can significantly improve join and filter operations.
2. **Use explicit casts**: Ensure that data types are correctly cast to avoid implicit type conversion at runtime.
3. **Avoid functions in the ON clause**: Functions can hinder the use of indexes. Ensure that any function used in the ON or WHERE clause does not prevent the use of indexes.
4. **Review aggregation and window functions**: Ensure that the use of `SUM` and window functions are optimized for the given workload.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ws_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    web_sales
JOIN 
    item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_category IN ('Men', 'Books', 'Electronics')
    AND d_date >= CAST('2001-06-15' AS DATE)
    AND d_date <= CAST('2001-06-15' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:
- **Date Range Condition**: Changed to use `>=` and `<=` for clarity and potentially better use of indexes.
- **Explicit Casts**: Ensured that all casts are explicit to avoid any runtime overhead due to implicit type conversions.

### Recommendations:
- **Indexing**: Ensure that columns used in joins (`ws_item_sk`, `i_item_sk`, `ws_sold_date_sk`, `d_date_sk`) and critical filter columns (`i_category`, `d_date`) are indexed.
- **Analyze Execution Plan**: Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze the query execution plan and identify any potential bottlenecks or areas for further optimization.

This query aims to be more efficient by ensuring clarity in operations and potentially better use of indexes. However, actual performance improvements would need to be verified with an execution plan analysis and considering the specific PostgreSQL configuration and hardware environment.
