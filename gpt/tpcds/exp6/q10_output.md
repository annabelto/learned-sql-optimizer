To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replaced comma-separated table listing in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs.
- **Explicit Join Conditions**: Moved join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs.
- **Subquery Joins**: Updated subqueries to use explicit JOINs between `store_sales`, `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `date_dim`.
- **Condition Movement**: Moved conditions related to `store_sales`, `web_sales`, and `catalog_sales` from WHERE to the respective ON clauses in subqueries.

These changes improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query by clearly defining join conditions and reducing the complexity of the WHERE clause.
