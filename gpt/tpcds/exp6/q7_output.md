To optimize the given query, I will apply the following rules in the specified order:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select i_item_id, avg(ss_quantity) agg1, avg(ss_list_price) agg2, avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3, avg(ss_sales_price) agg4 
from store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion 
where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
  and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
  and ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk 
  and ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk 
  and cd_gender = 'F' 
  and cd_marital_status = 'W' 
  and cd_education_status = 'College' 
  and (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') 
  and d_year = 2001 
group by i_item_id 
order by i_item_id 
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, 
       AVG(ss_quantity) AS agg1, 
       AVG(ss_list_price) AS agg2, 
       AVG(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, 
       AVG(ss_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM store_sales
JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001
JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk 
  AND cd_gender = 'F' 
  AND cd_marital_status = 'W' 
  AND cd_education_status = 'College'
JOIN promotion ON ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk 
  AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N')
GROUP BY i_item_id 
ORDER BY i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and specified the join conditions using the ON keyword. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** I moved relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs. This can help the query optimizer by reducing the number of rows early in the join process, potentially improving performance.

This rewritten query is clearer and potentially more efficient due to the explicit join conditions and the early filtering in the JOIN clauses.
