To achieve a better optimization of the provided query, I will focus on refining the join strategy, ensuring optimal use of indexes, and simplifying the query structure. This approach aims to reduce the computational overhead and improve the execution plan generated by PostgreSQL.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_manager_id,
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) AS avg_monthly_sales
    FROM 
        item
        JOIN store_sales ON item.i_item_sk = store_sales.ss_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1222 AND 1233
        AND (
            (
                item.i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics')
                AND item.i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help')
                AND item.i_brand IN ('scholaramalgamalg #14', 'scholaramalgamalg #7', 'exportiunivamalg #9', 'scholaramalgamalg #9')
            ) OR (
                item.i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men')
                AND item.i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants')
                AND item.i_brand IN ('amalgimporto #1', 'edu packscholar #1', 'exportiimporto #1', 'importoamalg #1')
            )
        )
    GROUP BY 
        i_manager_id, date_dim.d_moy
) AS tmp1
WHERE 
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales 
        ELSE NULL 
    END > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    i_manager_id, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Changes and Considerations:

1. **Join Order and Strategy**: The join order has been maintained as per the logical data flow from items to sales, ensuring that the joins are as efficient as possible. Each join is made on primary key to foreign key relationships, which should be indexed by default in a well-designed schema.

2. **Filter Placement**: The filters on `d_month_seq` and item attributes are strategically placed in the WHERE clause to reduce the dataset size early in the query execution. This helps in minimizing the amount of data that needs to be processed in subsequent operations.

3. **Use of Indexes**: The query assumes the presence of indexes on the join columns (`i_item_sk`, `ss_item_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk`) and the columns used in the WHERE clause (`d_month_seq`, `i_category`, `i_class`, `i_brand`). If these indexes are not present, they should be considered for creation to improve performance.

4. **Window Function**: The window function is used after the data has been filtered and grouped, which should minimize its computational overhead.

5. **Simplification and Readability**: The query has been formatted for better readability, which helps in maintenance and future optimizations.

This optimized query is designed to leverage PostgreSQL's strengths in handling joins and window functions efficiently. The performance ultimately depends on the database schema, the presence of appropriate indexes, and the distribution of data. Regular database maintenance like running ANALYZE for updated statistics and VACUUM for reclaiming storage and preventing table bloat is also recommended.
