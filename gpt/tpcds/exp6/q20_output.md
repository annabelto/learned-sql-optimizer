Given the consistent performance metrics between the original and the previously optimized queries, it's clear that the optimizations have not effectively improved the query execution time. To address this, I will re-evaluate the query with a focus on optimizing specific aspects that might have been overlooked, such as more efficient use of indexes, query structure, and possibly leveraging PostgreSQL-specific features.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(cs_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    item ON catalog_sales.cs_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    item.i_category IN ('Books', 'Music', 'Sports')
    AND date_dim.d_date BETWEEN '2002-06-18'::date AND '2002-06-18'::date + INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category, i_class, i_item_id, i_item_desc, revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Adjustments and Considerations:
1. **Efficient Indexing**: Ensure that there are effective indexes on `cs_item_sk`, `i_item_sk`, `cs_sold_date_sk`, `d_date_sk`, and particularly on `i_category` and the columns involved in the ORDER BY clause. If these indexes are not present, their creation could significantly improve performance.

2. **Query Execution Plan Review**: It's crucial to examine the execution plan for this query. Look for sequential scans that could be converted to index scans, and ensure that the joins are being executed efficiently.

3. **Simplified Date Casting**: Using PostgreSQL's native casting (`::date`) for simplicity and potential performance benefits.

4. **Materialized Views**: If the data in `catalog_sales`, `item`, or `date_dim` tables is relatively static and the query is run frequently, consider using materialized views to precompute parts of the query.

5. **Partitioning**: If the tables are large, consider partitioning them, especially `date_dim` by `d_date` and `item` by `i_category`, to improve query performance.

6. **Optimize Window Functions**: Ensure that the window function used for calculating `revenueratio` is optimized by ensuring that the windowing clause is using an optimal method for partitioning and that any necessary indexes are in place.

This revised query maintains the improvements from previous attempts while focusing on ensuring that the structure supports effective execution by the PostgreSQL query planner. If performance issues persist, further detailed investigation into the database's configuration, the size and distribution of the data, and specific system environment settings might be necessary.
