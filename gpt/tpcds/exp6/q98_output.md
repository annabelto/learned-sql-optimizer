To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as itemrevenue,
    sum(ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / sum(sum(ss_ext_sales_price)) over (partition by i_class) as revenueratio
from 
    store_sales,
    item,
    date_dim
where 
    ss_item_sk = i_item_sk and
    i_category in ('Men', 'Sports', 'Jewelry') and
    ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
    d_date between cast('1999-02-05' as date) and (cast('1999-02-05' as date) + 30)
group by 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
order by 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
select 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as itemrevenue,
    sum(ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / sum(sum(ss_ext_sales_price)) over (partition by i_class) as revenueratio
from 
    store_sales
join 
    item on ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
join 
    date_dim on ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
where 
    i_category in ('Men', 'Sports', 'Jewelry') and
    d_date between cast('1999-02-05' as date) and (cast('1999-02-05' as date) + 30)
group by 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
order by 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and specified the join conditions using the ON keyword. This makes the query easier to read and understand.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the conditions that link the tables (`ss_item_sk = i_item_sk` and `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`) from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses in the JOINs. This is a more standard way to express joins and can help the database optimizer understand the query structure better.
- The filter conditions on `i_category` and `d_date` remain in the WHERE clause as they do not serve as join conditions but rather filter the results after the joins have been made.

This optimized query should perform better in terms of readability and potentially execution, depending on the database's query planner and the underlying data distribution.
