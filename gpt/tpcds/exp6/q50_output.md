To further optimize the query, we need to focus on ensuring that the execution plan generated by PostgreSQL is as efficient as possible. This might involve revisiting the join conditions and ensuring that the most selective filters are applied as early as possible in the query execution process. Additionally, we should ensure that the database can leverage indexes effectively, particularly on the join and filter columns.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.s_store_name,
    s.s_company_id,
    s.s_street_number,
    s.s_street_name,
    s.s_street_type,
    s.s_suite_number,
    s.s_city,
    s.s_county,
    s.s_state,
    s.s_zip,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk > 30) AND (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk <= 60) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk > 60) AND (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk <= 90) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk > 90) AND (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk <= 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk > 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM 
    store_sales ss
JOIN 
    store_returns sr ON ss.ss_ticket_number = sr.sr_ticket_number AND ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk AND ss.ss_customer_sk = sr.sr_customer_sk
JOIN 
    store s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d2.d_year = 2001 AND d2.d_moy = 8
GROUP BY 
    s.s_store_name,
    s.s_company_id,
    s.s_street_number,
    s.s_street_name,
    s.s_street_type,
    s.s_suite_number,
    s.s_city,
    s.s_county,
    s.s_state,
    s.s_zip
ORDER BY 
    s.s_store_name,
    s.s_company_id,
    s.s_street_number,
    s.s_street_name,
    s.s_street_type,
    s.s_suite_number,
    s.s_city,
    s.s_county,
    s.s_state,
    s.s_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Changes:
- **Alias Usage**: Added clear aliases to each table to make the query more readable and ensure that there is no ambiguity in column references.
- **Selective Join Conditions**: Ensured that the join conditions are as selective as possible, particularly focusing on the conditions that involve the `store_returns` and `date_dim` tables.
- **Filter Placement**: Kept the filtering conditions on `date_dim d2` within the JOIN clause to ensure these filters are applied as early as possible, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in subsequent operations.

This query aims to maintain clarity while ensuring that the execution plan can leverage indexes effectively, particularly on the join columns and the columns used in the WHERE clause of the `date_dim` table. This should help in achieving a faster execution time compared to the original query.
