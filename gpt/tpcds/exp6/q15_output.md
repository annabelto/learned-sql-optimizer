Given the consistent performance results between the original and the optimized queries, it's clear that further optimization requires a deeper look into the specific characteristics of the data and the database configuration. However, I will attempt another optimization focusing on the most efficient use of indexes and ensuring that the most restrictive conditions are applied as early as possible in the query execution.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN customer ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN date_dim ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
WHERE date_dim.d_year = 2001 AND date_dim.d_qoy = 2
  AND (customer_address.ca_state IN ('CA', 'WA', 'GA') OR
       SUBSTR(customer_address.ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') OR
       catalog_sales.cs_sales_price > 500)
GROUP BY ca_zip
ORDER BY ca_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Adjustments and Rationale:
1. **Efficient Join Order**: The join order is maintained starting with `catalog_sales` and progressing through `customer`, `customer_address`, and `date_dim`. This order is chosen based on the assumption that starting with `catalog_sales` might be beneficial due to direct conditions on sales price which can be very selective.

2. **Index Utilization**: This query assumes the presence of effective indexes on:
   - `catalog_sales (cs_bill_customer_sk, cs_sold_date_sk, cs_sales_price)` for quick access and filtering based on sales conditions.
   - `customer (c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk)` for efficient joins.
   - `customer_address (ca_address_sk, ca_zip, ca_state)` for filtering based on state and zip.
   - `date_dim (d_date_sk, d_year, d_qoy)` to quickly filter dates.

3. **Filter Placement**: The filters on `d_year` and `d_qoy` are applied directly in the `WHERE` clause to reduce the dataset size at an early stage. The other conditions are strategically placed to ensure that they are applied after the joins but before the aggregation, optimizing the amount of data that needs to be processed.

4. **Execution Plan Review**: It's crucial to review the execution plan to ensure that the database is using the indexes effectively and that the joins are processed in an optimal order. Adjustments might be necessary based on this analysis.

5. **Parallel Query Execution**: If not already enabled, consider enabling parallel query execution in PostgreSQL, which can significantly improve performance for complex queries involving large datasets.

6. **Database Configuration Tuning**: Ensure that PostgreSQL configuration parameters such as `work_mem`, `shared_buffers`, and `maintenance_work_mem` are tuned to optimize the performance of such queries.

This approach aims to leverage PostgreSQL's indexing capabilities and join optimizations effectively, ensuring that data reduction happens early in the query process and that the system configuration is aligned with the query demands.
