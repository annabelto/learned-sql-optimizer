I apologize for the repeated errors in previous responses. Let's ensure the optimized query maintains the exact logical structure and output as the original query, while applying the specified rewrite rules correctly.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ss AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON ss.ss_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    WHERE i.i_category = 'Books' AND d.d_year = 2001 AND d.d_moy = 3 AND ca.ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
), cs AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, SUM(cs.cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM catalog_sales cs
    JOIN item i ON cs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON cs.cs_bill_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    WHERE i.i_category = 'Books' AND d.d_year = 2001 AND d.d_moy = 3 AND ca.ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
), ws AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, SUM(ws.ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM web_sales ws
    JOIN item i ON ws.ws_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim d ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON ws.ws_bill_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    WHERE i.i_category = 'Books' AND d.d_year = 2001 AND d.d_moy = 3 AND ca.ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
)
SELECT i_manufact_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT i_manufact_id, total_sales FROM ss
    UNION ALL
    SELECT i_manufact_id, total_sales FROM cs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT i_manufact_id, total_sales FROM ws
) AS tmp1
GROUP BY i_manufact_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replaced comma-separated tables with explicit `JOIN` syntax.
- **Join Conditions in ON Clauses**: Moved all join conditions to the `ON` clauses of the respective joins.
- **Filter Conditions in WHERE Clauses**: Kept the filter conditions (related to category, year, month, and GMT offset) in the `WHERE` clauses, as these are not directly related to how the tables are joined but rather to how the data is filtered post-join.
- **Maintained Original Logic**: Ensured that the logic for filtering and aggregating sales data based on item category, date, and customer address conditions is preserved as per the original query.

This revised query should now correctly reflect the logic of the original query while using optimized SQL practices and maintaining the output consistency.
