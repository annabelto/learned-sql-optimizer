Given the persistent challenge in improving the query performance beyond the original execution time, it's crucial to revisit the query structure and possibly simplify or reorganize the operations to better utilize the database's capabilities. This might involve rethinking the join strategy, the use of subqueries, and ensuring that the database's optimizer can effectively use indexes.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number) AS "order count",
    SUM(ws1.ws_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
    SUM(ws1.ws_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM 
    web_sales ws1
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site.web_site_sk
WHERE 
    date_dim.d_date BETWEEN '2002-5-01' AND (CAST('2002-5-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 days')
    AND customer_address.ca_state = 'OK'
    AND web_site.web_company_name = 'pri'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM web_returns wr1 
        WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number
    )
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM web_sales ws2 
        WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number 
        AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
    )
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Simplified Join Conditions:** The join conditions are kept straightforward and directly linked to the primary keys and foreign keys, which should ideally be indexed. This ensures that the database can efficiently locate and join the relevant rows.

2. **Optimized Subqueries:** The `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries are optimized to use `SELECT 1` instead of `SELECT *`. This minimizes the data processed in these subqueries, focusing solely on the existence check rather than retrieving unnecessary data.

3. **Filter Placement:** Filters that are not directly related to join conditions are placed in the `WHERE` clause. This maintains clarity and ensures that these filters are applied after the joins, potentially reducing the dataset early in the execution plan.

4. **Index Utilization:** The query assumes that there are effective indexes on the columns used in join conditions (`ws_ship_date_sk`, `ws_ship_addr_sk`, `ws_web_site_sk`, `d_date_sk`) and the columns used in WHERE conditions (`d_date`, `ca_state`, `web_company_name`). If these indexes are not present, adding them could significantly improve performance.

5. **Execution Plan Review:** It is crucial to review the execution plan for this query to ensure that the joins are being executed in an optimal order and that the database is using the indexes effectively. Adjustments to the query or the database schema (like adding or modifying indexes) might be necessary based on this review.

This version of the query is designed to leverage efficient join operations and selective filters to minimize the amount of data processed and improve query performance. If performance issues persist, further analysis of the execution plan and potential index tuning should be considered.
