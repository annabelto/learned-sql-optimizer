To achieve better performance than the original query, I will focus on refining the join strategy, ensuring optimal use of indexes, and minimizing the computational overhead. I will also ensure that the query is structured to leverage PostgreSQL's strengths in handling joins and aggregations efficiently.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.c_last_name,
    c.c_first_name,
    c.c_salutation,
    c.c_preferred_cust_flag,
    ss.ss_ticket_number,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM 
    store_sales ss
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    store s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
JOIN 
    household_demographics hd ON ss.ss_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    customer c ON ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
WHERE 
    d.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
    AND d.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
    AND s.s_county = 'Williamson County'
    AND (hd.hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' OR hd.hd_buy_potential = '5001-10000')
    AND hd.hd_vehicle_count > 0
    AND (hd.hd_dep_count / NULLIF(hd.hd_vehicle_count, 0)) > 1
GROUP BY 
    ss.ss_ticket_number, 
    c.c_customer_sk, c.c_last_name, c.c_first_name, c.c_salutation, c.c_preferred_cust_flag
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) BETWEEN 1 AND 5
ORDER BY 
    cnt DESC, 
    c.c_last_name ASC;
```

### Changes and Justifications:

1. **Direct Join Strategy**: The query directly joins all necessary tables without using a subquery. This approach can help the PostgreSQL optimizer better understand the relationships and potentially optimize the join order and method.

2. **Efficient Filtering**: The WHERE clause is structured to apply the most restrictive filters early. This includes filtering on `d_dom`, `d_year`, and `s_county` which are likely indexed and can significantly reduce the number of rows processed.

3. **Use of NULLIF for Safe Division**: The division operation is safeguarded with `NULLIF` to avoid division by zero errors and unnecessary CASE statements.

4. **Streamlined Aggregation and Filtering**: The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are used effectively to group the results and filter groups based on the count of records, which is done after the joins to minimize the amount of data being aggregated.

5. **Index Utilization**: This query assumes the presence of indexes on the join columns (`ss_sold_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, `ss_hdemo_sk`, `ss_customer_sk`) and key filtering columns (`d_dom`, `d_year`, `s_county`). If not already indexed, adding indexes on these columns could improve performance.

This revised query is designed to optimize the use of indexes, reduce the dataset size early in the execution, and ensure efficient aggregation, which should help in achieving better performance than the original query.
