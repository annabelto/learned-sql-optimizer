To further optimize the query, I will revisit the join conditions and ensure that all possible optimizations are correctly applied. I will also ensure that the query is structured in a way that might leverage indexes more effectively, if they exist.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    w_state,
    i_item_id,
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN (CAST(d_date AS DATE) < CAST('2001-05-02' AS DATE)) 
            THEN cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0) 
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS sales_before,
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN (CAST(d_date AS DATE) >= CAST('2001-05-02' AS DATE)) 
            THEN cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0) 
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS sales_after
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    catalog_returns ON cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk
JOIN 
    warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
    AND d_date BETWEEN (CAST('2001-05-02' AS DATE) - 30) AND (CAST('2001-05-02' AS DATE) + 30)
GROUP BY 
    w_state, i_item_id
ORDER BY 
    w_state, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Changes Made:

1. **Reordered Joins:** The joins have been reordered to potentially leverage the filtering on `i_current_price` earlier in the query execution. This assumes that the `item` table might have fewer rows matching the price condition, which can reduce the size of the dataset being joined.
2. **Maintained Explicit Join Conditions:** All join conditions remain explicitly defined in the JOIN clauses, ensuring clarity and potentially better use of indexes.
3. **Preserved WHERE Conditions:** The WHERE clause remains focused on filtering items based on price and date, which are likely selective filters.

This version of the query aims to optimize the execution by potentially reducing the number of rows involved in the joins early in the process, assuming that the `item` table's filter (`i_current_price`) significantly reduces the dataset size. This should help in improving the performance compared to the original query.
