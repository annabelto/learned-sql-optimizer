To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Application of Rules:

1. **Convert comma-separated table list to explicit JOIN syntax.**
2. **Replace implicit join conditions in the WHERE clause with explicit ON conditions in the JOIN clauses.**
3. **Move relevant filtering conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause where appropriate.**

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    x.w_warehouse_name, 
    x.i_item_id, 
    x.inv_before, 
    x.inv_after
FROM (
    SELECT 
        w.w_warehouse_name, 
        i.i_item_id, 
        SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(d.d_date AS DATE) < CAST('1999-06-22' AS DATE) THEN inv.inv_quantity_on_hand ELSE 0 END) AS inv_before, 
        SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(d.d_date AS DATE) >= CAST('1999-06-22' AS DATE) THEN inv.inv_quantity_on_hand ELSE 0 END) AS inv_after
    FROM 
        inventory inv
        JOIN warehouse w ON inv.inv_warehouse_sk = w.w_warehouse_sk
        JOIN item i ON i.i_item_sk = inv.inv_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim d ON inv.inv_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        i.i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
        AND d.d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-06-22' AS DATE) - INTERVAL '30 days' AND CAST('1999-06-22' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY 
        w.w_warehouse_name, 
        i.i_item_id
) x
WHERE 
    (CASE WHEN x.inv_before > 0 THEN x.inv_after / x.inv_before ELSE NULL END) BETWEEN 2.0/3.0 AND 3.0/2.0
ORDER BY 
    x.w_warehouse_name, 
    x.i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:

- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query now uses explicit `JOIN` clauses instead of listing tables in the `FROM` clause separated by commas.
- **Explicit Join Conditions**: All join conditions are explicitly stated in the `ON` clauses of the respective `JOIN` statements.
- **Filtering Conditions**: Conditions that pertain to specific tables are moved to the respective `JOIN` clauses where possible. The filtering on `i_current_price` and `d_date` remains in the `WHERE` clause of the subquery because they are not directly related to the join conditions but are rather general filters.
- **Subquery and Aggregation**: The subquery is used to perform the necessary aggregation and filtering before applying the final filtering condition in the outer query.
- **Performance Consideration**: This restructuring should help the database engine optimize the execution plan by clearly understanding the relationships between tables and the context of each condition.
