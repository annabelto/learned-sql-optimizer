To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ws_wh AS (
    SELECT ws1.ws_order_number, ws1.ws_warehouse_sk AS wh1, ws2.ws_warehouse_sk AS wh2
    FROM web_sales ws1
    JOIN web_sales ws2 ON ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
    WHERE ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number) AS "order count",
    SUM(ws1.ws_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
    SUM(ws1.ws_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM 
    web_sales ws1
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site.web_site_sk
WHERE 
    date_dim.d_date BETWEEN '2001-4-01' AND (CAST('2001-4-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 days')
    AND customer_address.ca_state = 'VA'
    AND web_site.web_company_name = 'pri'
    AND ws1.ws_order_number IN (SELECT ws_order_number FROM ws_wh)
    AND ws1.ws_order_number IN (
        SELECT wr_order_number 
        FROM web_returns
        JOIN ws_wh ON web_returns.wr_order_number = ws_wh.ws_order_number
    )
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that were logically part of the join (such as linking foreign keys and primary keys between tables) were moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the corresponding JOIN. This can help the query optimizer by reducing the dataset early during the join process rather than filtering after joins.
- **General:** I ensured that all table aliases are consistent and clearly defined, and I used explicit aliases for all fields to avoid ambiguity. This helps in understanding the query and ensures that it executes correctly in environments with multiple similar column names across tables.
