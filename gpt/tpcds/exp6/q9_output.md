The error you encountered indicates that the subqueries within the `CASE` statements are returning more than one row, which is not allowed in this context. To correct this, we need to ensure that each subquery used in the `CASE` statements returns exactly one row. This can be achieved by aggregating the data more effectively in the CTE and ensuring that the conditions within the `CASE` statements are properly set to return a single value.

### Optimized Query

```sql

    SELECT 
        CASE

### Explanation

1. **CTE Definition**: The CTE `store_sales_summary` now groups the data into predefined quantity ranges, ensuring that each range is distinctly grouped and aggregated. This prevents multiple rows from being returned for each range in the subqueries.

2. **Subquery Corrections**: Each subquery within the `CASE` statements now correctly references a unique `quantity_range`, ensuring that only one row is returned per subquery, which resolves the error.

3. **Filtering**: The query continues to filter the `reason` table based on `r_reason_sk = 1`, which is necessary for the query's logic.

This revised query should execute without errors and provide the intended results, optimizing both performance and clarity by using a CTE and ensuring each subquery returns a single row.
