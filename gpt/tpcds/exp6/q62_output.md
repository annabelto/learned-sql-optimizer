Given the feedback that the previous optimizations did not improve performance, and considering that both the original and optimized queries run in the same amount of time (0.1 seconds), it suggests that the original query might already be quite efficient or that the database is small enough that the optimizations do not have a noticeable impact. However, I will attempt another optimization focusing on simplifying and streamlining the query further.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    substr(w.w_warehouse_name, 1, 20) AS warehouse_name,
    sm.sm_type,
    web.web_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk > 30 AND ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk <= 60) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk > 60 AND ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk <= 90) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk > 90 AND ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk <= 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws.ws_ship_date_sk - ws.ws_sold_date_sk > 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM 
    web_sales ws
JOIN 
    warehouse w ON ws.ws_warehouse_sk = w.w_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    ship_mode sm ON ws.ws_ship_mode_sk = sm.sm_ship_mode_sk
JOIN 
    web_site web ON ws.ws_web_site_sk = web.web_site_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON ws.ws_ship_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    d.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1223 AND 1234
GROUP BY 
    substr(w.w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm.sm_type,
    web.web_name
ORDER BY 
    warehouse_name,
    sm.sm_type,
    web.web_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Changes and Considerations:
1. **Simplified CASE Statements**: Combined conditions within the `CASE` statements to reduce complexity.
2. **Consistent Aliasing and Ordering**: Used consistent aliasing for clarity and modified the `ORDER BY` clause to use the alias, which can sometimes help with optimization depending on the database system.
3. **Join Order**: Maintained a logical join order based on the filtering and grouping needs.

### Additional Recommendations:
- **Indexing**: Ensure that there are indexes on all join keys (`ws_warehouse_sk`, `ws_ship_mode_sk`, `ws_web_site_sk`, `ws_ship_date_sk`) and the column used in the `WHERE` clause (`d_month_seq`). If not already indexed, consider adding indexes.
- **Analyze Execution Plan**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check the execution plan and identify any potential bottlenecks.
- **Database Configuration**: Check if the database configuration settings such as buffer sizes are optimized for the workload.

This query aims to maintain the logical structure of the original while simplifying some parts to potentially aid the database optimizer in executing the query more efficiently.
