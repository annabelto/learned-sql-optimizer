Given the consistent performance results between the original and previously optimized queries, it's clear that further optimization requires a more nuanced approach, potentially revisiting the fundamental structure or leveraging specific database features that might not have been fully utilized. Here, I will attempt a different approach, focusing on potential PostgreSQL-specific optimizations and ensuring the query is structured to take advantage of indexing and execution planning.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
       i.i_brand AS brand, 
       SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM item i
JOIN store_sales ss ON i.i_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk
JOIN date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
WHERE i.i_manager_id = 52
  AND d.d_moy = 11
  AND d.d_year = 2000
GROUP BY i.i_brand, i.i_brand_id
ORDER BY ext_price DESC, i.i_brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Changes and Rationale:
1. **Revisiting Join Order**: The join order is maintained with `item` joined to `store_sales`, then `date_dim`. This order is chosen based on an assumption (which should be verified by actual data distribution and table sizes) that filtering `item` first on `i_manager_id` might reduce the number of rows early in the join process.

2. **Index Utilization**:
   - Ensure that there are efficient indexes on `i_item_sk`, `ss_item_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, and `d_date_sk`. These are crucial for the joins.
   - Consider composite indexes that might include the filter conditions, such as on `item(i_item_sk, i_manager_id)` and `date_dim(d_date_sk, d_moy, d_year)`.

3. **Cost-Based Optimization**:
   - PostgreSQL uses a cost-based optimizer, so ensure that the cost settings in PostgreSQL reflect the actual operational environment. Sometimes, the default cost settings might not be ideal for specific hardware or data distributions.

4. **Analyze and Vacuum**:
   - Regularly run `ANALYZE` and `VACUUM` on the tables to ensure that the statistics are up-to-date and that there is no unnecessary space or dead tuples that might affect query performance.

5. **Execution Plan Analysis**:
   - Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check the execution plan for both the original and optimized queries. Look for any sequential scans that could be converted to index scans, and ensure that the joins are being executed in an efficient manner.

6. **Query Tuning and Settings**:
   - Adjust PostgreSQL configuration settings such as `work_mem` and `maintenance_work_mem` to better suit the query needs, especially if the joins are large or if sorting/grouping operations are memory-intensive.

This approach aims to refine the query structure and ensure that it is aligned with PostgreSQL's strengths, such as its cost-based optimizer and indexing capabilities. However, actual improvements should be validated by testing in the specific environment where the database is hosted, as performance can vary widely based on many factors including data distribution, table sizes, and system resources.
