To ensure the output of the optimized query matches the original while attempting to improve performance, I will carefully review and adjust the query, maintaining the logical structure and output of the original query.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_manufact_id, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, 
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manufact_id) AS avg_quarterly_sales
    FROM 
        item
        JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq IN (1186, 1187, 1188, 1189, 1190, 1191, 1192, 1193, 1194, 1195, 1196, 1197)
        AND (
            (
                i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics')
                AND i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help')
                AND i_brand IN ('scholaramalgamalg #14', 'scholaramalgamalg #7', 'exportiunivamalg #9', 'scholaramalgamalg #9')
            ) OR (
                i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men')
                AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants')
                AND i_brand IN ('amalgimporto #1', 'edu packscholar #1', 'exportiimporto #1', 'importoamalg #1')
            )
        )
    GROUP BY 
        i_manufact_id, d_qoy
) AS tmp1
WHERE 
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_quarterly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_quarterly_sales) / avg_quarterly_sales 
        ELSE NULL 
    END > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    avg_quarterly_sales, sum_sales, i_manufact_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Key Adjustments Made:
1. **Join Conditions**: Maintained explicit JOIN conditions as in the previous optimizations.
2. **Filter Conditions**: Kept the `IN` clause for `d_month_seq` to match the original query's logic exactly.
3. **Group By Clause**: Corrected to group by `i_manufact_id` and `d_qoy` as in the original query's subquery, ensuring the output structure matches.
4. **Window Function**: Ensured the window function is correctly applied over `i_manufact_id` to match the original logic.

These adjustments are aimed at ensuring the logical equivalence with the original query while maintaining explicit JOIN syntax and conditions for potentially better performance. The focus is on preserving the original query's output structure and semantics.
