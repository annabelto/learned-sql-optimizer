To further optimize the query for better performance, let's focus on refining the join conditions and ensuring that the execution plan is as efficient as possible. We'll also consider the possibility of simplifying expressions and ensuring that the database can utilize indexes effectively.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    sub.gross_margin,
    sub.i_category,
    sub.i_class,
    sub.lochierarchy,
    sub.rank_within_parent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ss_net_profit) / SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS gross_margin,
        i_category,
        i_class,
        grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class) AS lochierarchy,
        rank() OVER (
            PARTITION BY grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class), 
            CASE 
                WHEN grouping(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category 
            END 
            ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) / SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) ASC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
        JOIN item ON item.i_item_sk = store_sales.ss_item_sk
        JOIN store ON store.s_store_sk = store_sales.ss_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d1.d_year = 2000 AND store.s_state = 'TN'
    GROUP BY 
        ROLLUP(i_category, i_class)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    lochierarchy DESC,
    CASE 
        WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category 
    END,
    rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Join Conditions**: I've maintained explicit join conditions, ensuring that each join is clearly defined with its respective foreign key relationship.
2. **Filter Placement**: The filters for `d_year` and `s_state` are placed in the WHERE clause. This decision is based on the assumption that filtering after joins might be more efficient in this specific context, depending on the distribution of data and the selectivity of other conditions.
3. **Simplification and Readability**: The query maintains a clear structure, with filters and joins logically organized to enhance readability and potentially improve execution plan generation by the database optimizer.
4. **Index Utilization**: The query is structured to potentially make better use of indexes on `d_date_sk`, `i_item_sk`, and `s_store_sk`. Ensuring these columns are indexed would be crucial for performance.

This revised query aims to balance readability, maintainability, and performance by structuring joins and filters in a way that should be conducive to efficient query execution. The performance of this query would ideally be tested with actual database statistics and indexes to ensure that it indeed performs better than the original.
