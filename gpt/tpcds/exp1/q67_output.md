To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the performance without altering the semantics of the query. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Grouping Operations**: Since the query uses `ROLLUP`, ensure that no unnecessary grouping sets are computed.

3. **Use of Proper Joins**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and potentially more efficient execution plans.

4. **Column Pruning**: Remove unnecessary columns from the SELECT clause that are not used elsewhere in the outer query.

5. **Limit Pushdown**: If possible, push the LIMIT operation closer to the data retrieval stage to reduce the amount of data processed.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_category, 
    i_class, 
    i_brand, 
    i_product_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    d_moy, 
    s_store_id, 
    sumsales, 
    rk
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        i_product_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_qoy, 
        d_moy, 
        s_store_id, 
        sumsales, 
        rank() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) AS rk
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            i_category, 
            i_class, 
            i_brand, 
            i_product_name, 
            d_year, 
            d_qoy, 
            d_moy, 
            s_store_id, 
            SUM(COALESCE(ss_sales_price * ss_quantity, 0)) AS sumsales
        FROM 
            store_sales
            JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
            JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
            JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        WHERE 
            d_month_seq BETWEEN 1217 AND 1228
        GROUP BY 
            ROLLUP(i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id)
    ) AS dw1
) AS dw2
WHERE 
    rk <= 100
ORDER BY 
    i_category, 
    i_class, 
    i_brand, 
    i_product_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    d_moy, 
    s_store_id, 
    sumsales, 
    rk
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOINs**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit JOINs for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The `WHERE` clause filtering on `d_month_seq` is placed immediately after the joins, reducing the size of the dataset for the subsequent GROUP BY operation.
- **Column Pruning**: All selected columns are used in the final output or in ORDER BY and PARTITION BY clauses, so no additional pruning was necessary.
- **Limit Pushdown**: The LIMIT is already at the outermost level, which is appropriate for this query structure.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage of the query by minimizing the amount of data shuffled and processed at each step.
