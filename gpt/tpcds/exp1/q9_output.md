To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that aim to reduce the number of subqueries and redundant data access. The primary rules we'll use include:

1. **Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundant subqueries by replacing them with a single computation that can be reused.
2. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (conditions) as close as possible to where the data originates, which can reduce the amount of data processed.
3. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated to simplify the query.

### Analysis of the Query:
The query repeatedly accesses the `store_sales` table with similar conditions but different aggregate functions and thresholds. Each bucket calculation involves two subqueries: one for counting and one for averaging, conditioned on the count exceeding a threshold.

### Applying Optimization Rules:

#### Step 1: Common Subexpression Elimination
We notice that each bucket calculation involves a count and an average calculation over the same subset of `store_sales`. We can compute the count and average in a single pass and use these results in the CASE statement.

#### Step 2: Predicate Pushdown
We ensure that the conditions on `ss_quantity` are applied directly in the subquery that computes the count and average, minimizing the amount of data processed.

#### Step 3: Join Elimination
The query includes a FROM clause with the `reason` table, but it does not seem to affect the results of the subquery calculations. If the `reason` table is only used to filter on `r_reason_sk = 1` and does not affect other parts of the query, we might consider removing it if it's confirmed that this does not alter the intended results.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN bucket1_count > 1071 THEN bucket1_avg_ext_tax
    ELSE bucket1_avg_net_paid_inc_tax
  END AS bucket1,
  CASE
    WHEN bucket2_count > 39161 THEN bucket2_avg_ext_tax
    ELSE bucket2_avg_net_paid_inc_tax
  END AS bucket2,
  CASE
    WHEN bucket3_count > 29434 THEN bucket3_avg_ext_tax
    ELSE bucket3_avg_net_paid_inc_tax
  END AS bucket3,
  CASE
    WHEN bucket4_count > 6568 THEN bucket4_avg_ext_tax
    ELSE bucket4_avg_net_paid_inc_tax
  END AS bucket4,
  CASE
    WHEN bucket5_count > 21216 THEN bucket5_avg_ext_tax
    ELSE bucket5_avg_net_paid_inc_tax
  END AS bucket5
FROM (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) AS bucket1_count,
    AVG(ss_ext_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) AS bucket1_avg_ext_tax,
    AVG(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) AS bucket1_avg_net_paid_inc_tax,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) AS bucket2_count,
    AVG(ss_ext_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) AS bucket2_avg_ext_tax,
    AVG(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) AS bucket2_avg_net_paid_inc_tax,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60) AS bucket3_count,
    AVG(ss_ext_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60) AS bucket3_avg_ext_tax,
    AVG(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60) AS bucket3_avg_net_paid_inc_tax,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80) AS bucket4_count,
    AVG(ss_ext_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80) AS bucket4_avg_ext_tax,
    AVG(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80) AS bucket4_avg_net_paid_inc_tax,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100) AS bucket5_count,
    AVG(ss_ext_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100) AS bucket5_avg_ext_tax,
    AVG(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100) AS bucket5_avg_net_paid_inc_tax
  FROM store_sales
) AS subquery;
```

This optimized query reduces the number of subqueries by calculating all necessary statistics in a single pass over the `store_sales` table, using conditional aggregation to separate the results for each bucket. This should significantly improve performance by reducing the number of scans over the `store_sales` table.
