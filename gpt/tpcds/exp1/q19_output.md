To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance by reducing the amount of data processed and the complexity of the operations. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates (conditions) as close as possible to the data source in the query. By applying filters early, we reduce the size of the intermediate result sets that need to be processed in later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to ensure that smaller, more restrictive joins happen earlier, which can reduce the size of intermediate results.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (from the WHERE clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can make the query more readable and can also help the database optimizer understand the join conditions better.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Removing unnecessary columns from the SELECT and GROUP BY clauses that are not needed for the final result can reduce the amount of data being processed.

### Applying the Rules:

**Original Query:**
```sql
select i_brand_id brand_id, i_brand brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact, sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
from date_dim, store_sales, item, customer, customer_address, store
where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
  and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
  and i_manager_id=14
  and d_moy=11
  and d_year=2002
  and ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  and substr(ca_zip,1,5) <> substr(s_zip,1,5)
  and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
group by i_brand, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
order by ext_price desc, i_brand, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, i.i_brand AS brand, i.i_manufact_id, i.i_manufact, SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM item i
JOIN store_sales ss ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk AND d.d_moy = 11 AND d.d_year = 2002
JOIN customer c ON ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
JOIN store s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk AND substr(ca.ca_zip, 1, 5) <> substr(s.s_zip, 1, 5)
WHERE i.i_manager_id = 14
GROUP BY i.i_brand, i.i_brand_id, i.i_manufact_id, i.i_manufact
ORDER BY ext_price DESC, i.i_brand, i.i_brand_id, i.i_manufact_id, i.i_manufact
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved conditions related to `date_dim`, `item`, and `store` directly into the JOIN conditions to filter rows earlier.
- **Join Reordering**: Started with the `item` table filtered by `i_manager_id`, which is likely highly selective, then proceeded with `store_sales`, and so on.
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Converted all joins to explicit syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Ensured only necessary columns are selected and grouped.

These changes should help in reducing the processing time and resource usage of the query by minimizing the amount of data flowing through the query execution plan.
