To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter conditions as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated. However, in this query, all joins seem necessary for the final output.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (using commas in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax. This makes the query easier to read and understand, and in some cases, can help the database optimize the join order.

4. **Column Pruning**: Only select the columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in JOINs, WHERE clauses, or aggregates.

5. **Date Operations**: Simplify operations on dates if possible.

Let's apply these rules to the given query:

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(cs_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    catalog_sales,
    item,
    date_dim
WHERE 
    cs_item_sk = i_item_sk 
    AND i_category IN ('Books', 'Music', 'Sports')
    AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-06-18' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-06-18' AS DATE) + 30)
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(cs_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_category IN ('Books', 'Music', 'Sports')
    AND d_date BETWEEN DATE '2002-06-18' AND DATE '2002-06-18' + INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and potential optimization.
2. **Date Operations**: Simplified the date operations by using `DATE` and `INTERVAL` directly, which can be more readable and might be optimized better by PostgreSQL.
3. **Predicate Pushdown**: The filters are already close to the data sources, and since the query uses aggregates, further pushdown is not applicable.

These changes should help in improving the readability and potentially the performance of the query by making better use of PostgreSQL's query planner and execution engine.
