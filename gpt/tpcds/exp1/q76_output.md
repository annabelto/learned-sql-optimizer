To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (conditions in the WHERE clause) closer to the data source in subqueries. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the higher levels of the query.

2. **Projection Pushdown**: This rule moves the projection of columns (the selection of specific columns) closer to the data source. This minimizes the amount of data that needs to be carried through the query processing stages.

3. **Eliminate Redundant Columns**: Remove columns from the SELECT clause that are not used elsewhere in the query outside of the subquery.

4. **Use Explicit JOINs**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated tables in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax to improve readability and potentially allow the optimizer to better understand the join conditions.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    channel, 
    col_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    i_category, 
    COUNT(*) AS sales_cnt, 
    SUM(ext_sales_price) AS sales_amt 
FROM 
(
    SELECT 
        'store' AS channel, 
        'ss_customer_sk' AS col_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_qoy, 
        i_category, 
        ss_ext_sales_price AS ext_sales_price 
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE 
        ss_customer_sk IS NULL

    UNION ALL 

    SELECT 
        'web' AS channel, 
        'ws_promo_sk' AS col_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_qoy, 
        i_category, 
        ws_ext_sales_price AS ext_sales_price 
    FROM 
        web_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE 
        ws_promo_sk IS NULL

    UNION ALL 

    SELECT 
        'catalog' AS channel, 
        'cs_bill_customer_sk' AS col_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_qoy, 
        i_category, 
        cs_ext_sales_price AS ext_sales_price 
    FROM 
        catalog_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE 
        cs_bill_customer_sk IS NULL
) foo 
GROUP BY 
    channel, 
    col_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    i_category 
ORDER BY 
    channel, 
    col_name, 
    d_year, 
    d_qoy, 
    i_category 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the `WHERE` conditions into each respective subquery to filter rows as early as possible.
- **Projection Pushdown**: Ensured that only necessary columns are selected in the subqueries.
- **Use Explicit JOINs**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit JOINs for clarity and potential performance improvement.
- **Eliminate Redundant Columns**: Ensured that only columns used in the final output or necessary for joins/conditions are selected in the subqueries.

These changes should help in optimizing the query execution by reducing the amount of data processed and clarifying the join conditions for the query optimizer.
