To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution.
2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not contribute to the final result.
3. **Projection Pushdown**: Limit the columns retrieved from the tables to only those required for the final output or intermediate computations.
4. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control over join conditions.

### Applying the Rules:

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown:
   - Move conditions related to `date_dim`, `customer_demographics`, `household_demographics`, and `customer_address` closer to their respective table references. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be joined.

#### 2. Projection Pushdown:
   - Only select columns that are necessary for joins and final output from each table.

#### 3. Use of Explicit Joins:
   - Convert the query to use explicit JOIN syntax (INNER JOIN) which is more readable and standard.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    cc.cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center, 
    cc.cc_name AS Call_Center_Name, 
    cc.cc_manager AS Manager, 
    SUM(cr.cr_net_loss) AS Returns_Loss
FROM 
    call_center cc
JOIN 
    catalog_returns cr ON cr.cr_call_center_sk = cc.cc_call_center_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON cr.cr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk AND d.d_year = 2000 AND d.d_moy = 12
JOIN 
    customer c ON cr.cr_returning_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd ON c.c_current_cdemo_sk = cd.cd_demo_sk AND 
    ((cd.cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd.cd_education_status = 'Unknown') OR 
     (cd.cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd.cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'))
JOIN 
    household_demographics hd ON c.c_current_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk AND hd.hd_buy_potential LIKE 'Unknown%'
JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk AND ca.ca_gmt_offset = -7
GROUP BY 
    cc.cc_call_center_id, cc.cc_name, cc.cc_manager
ORDER BY 
    SUM(cr.cr_net_loss) DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit Joins**: The query now uses explicit `JOIN` syntax, which clearly specifies the join conditions and the type of join.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions related to specific tables are moved directly into the `JOIN` conditions, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages.
- **Projection Pushdown**: The query only selects the necessary columns for output and intermediate steps, reducing memory usage and potentially improving cache performance.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data shuffling and more efficient use of indexes and table scans.
