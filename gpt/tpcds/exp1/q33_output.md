To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by reusing the results of common sub-expressions used multiple times in the query.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute additional columns or rows to the result, it can be eliminated.

4. **Simplifying Subqueries**: Convert subqueries into joins or simpler queries where possible to reduce complexity and improve execution plans.

### Applying the Rules:

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
Push predicates into the subqueries to reduce the amount of data scanned and processed in each subquery.

#### Step 2: Common Sub-expression Elimination
The subquery to fetch `i_manufact_id` from `item` where `i_category` is 'Books' is repeated in all main subqueries (`ss`, `cs`, `ws`). We can compute this once and reuse it.

#### Step 3: Join Elimination
We can't eliminate any joins without changing the logic of the query, as all joins contribute to the filtering conditions.

#### Step 4: Simplifying Subqueries
Convert the repeated subquery into a CTE or a temporary table to avoid multiple executions.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH item_filter AS (
    SELECT i_manufact_id, i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Books'
),
ss AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim d ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item_filter i ON ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2001 AND d_moy = 3 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
),
cs AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim d ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON cs_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item_filter i ON cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2001 AND d_moy = 3 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
),
ws AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_dim d ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item_filter i ON ws_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2001 AND d_moy = 3 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
)
SELECT i_manufact_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM ss
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM cs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM ws
) tmp1
GROUP BY i_manufact_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query reduces redundant subquery executions and pushes relevant predicates closer to the data sources, potentially improving execution time and resource usage.
