To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the rules and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (conditions) closer to the data source, reducing the number of rows processed early in the execution plan.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by reusing the results of common sub-expressions.
3. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated to simplify the query.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves three subqueries that select from `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` respectively, joined with `date_dim` and `customer`. Each subquery filters on `d_month_seq` and uses `EXCEPT` to subtract results from the first subquery with the subsequent ones.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
We push the condition `d_month_seq between 1202 and 1202+11` directly into the respective joins with `date_dim` in each subquery. This reduces the amount of data joined with `customer` and `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, or `web_sales`.

#### Step 2: Common Sub-expression Elimination
The condition on `d_month_seq` is repeated across all subqueries. We can compute this once and reuse it. However, since this is tightly coupled with each sales table's join condition, the practical application in SQL might be limited without creating temporary views or tables.

#### Step 3: Join Elimination
In this specific query, all joins are necessary to retrieve the required fields and to apply the correct filters, so no joins can be eliminated.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    (
        SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
        FROM store_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
        JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
        WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1202 AND 1213
    )
    EXCEPT
    (
        SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
        FROM catalog_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
        JOIN customer ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
        WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1202 AND 1213
    )
    EXCEPT
    (
        SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
        FROM web_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
        JOIN customer ON web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
        WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1202 AND 1213
    )
) AS cool_cust;
```

### Explanation
- The `WHERE` clause has been pushed down to directly follow the joins in each subquery, ensuring that the filtering on `d_month_seq` happens as early as possible.
- The `EXCEPT` operations remain as they are essential for the logic of the query.
- No further simplifications were applied as they would alter the semantics of the query or are not feasible without additional transformations or temporary structures.
