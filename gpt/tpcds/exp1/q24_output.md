To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, reduce the amount of data processed, and improve execution efficiency without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move filters as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundancy within the query by reusing the results of common sub-expressions.

3. **Eliminate Redundant Group By**: If the grouping columns are the same and the aggregates do not interfere with each other, consider combining the queries.

4. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify or remove unnecessary expressions or conditions.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ssales AS (
    SELECT 
        c_last_name,
        c_first_name,
        s_store_name,
        ca_state,
        s_state,
        i_color,
        i_current_price,
        i_manager_id,
        i_units,
        i_size,
        SUM(ss_net_paid) AS netpaid
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN store_returns ON ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
        JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        c_birth_country <> UPPER(ca_country)
        AND s_zip = ca_zip
        AND s_market_id = 5
    GROUP BY 
        c_last_name,
        c_first_name,
        s_store_name,
        ca_state,
        s_state,
        i_color,
        i_current_price,
        i_manager_id,
        i_units,
        i_size
),
filtered_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        c_last_name,
        c_first_name,
        s_store_name,
        netpaid
    FROM 
        ssales
    WHERE 
        i_color IN ('aquamarine', 'seashell')
),
avg_netpaid AS (
    SELECT 
        0.05 * AVG(netpaid) AS threshold
    FROM 
        filtered_sales
)
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    s_store_name,
    SUM(netpaid) AS paid
FROM 
    filtered_sales
GROUP BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    s_store_name
HAVING 
    SUM(netpaid) > (SELECT threshold FROM avg_netpaid)
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    s_store_name;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the color filter (`i_color IN ('aquamarine', 'seashell')`) closer to the data source in the `filtered_sales` CTE.
- **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Created a separate CTE `avg_netpaid` to calculate the average net paid threshold once, which is used in the `HAVING` clause.
- **Eliminate Redundant Group By**: Combined the results for both colors into a single output by filtering on colors in a single step.
- **Simplify Expressions**: Removed redundant expressions and simplified the structure for clarity and performance.

These changes should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and reusing computed results effectively.
