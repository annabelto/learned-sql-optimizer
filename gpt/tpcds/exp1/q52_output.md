To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filtering predicates closer to the data sources. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: This involves rearranging the joins to minimize the size of intermediate results. This can be particularly effective when combined with predicate pushdown.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) for better readability and control over join mechanisms.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Grouping Attributes**: Ensure that only necessary columns are included in the GROUP BY clause.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    item.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM 
    date_dim dt
JOIN 
    store_sales ss ON dt.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    item ON ss.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
WHERE 
    item.i_manager_id = 1
    AND dt.d_moy = 12
    AND dt.d_year = 2000
GROUP BY 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_brand_id,
    item.i_brand
ORDER BY 
    dt.d_year,
    ext_price DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions `item.i_manager_id = 1`, `dt.d_moy = 12`, and `dt.d_year = 2000` are applied directly in the WHERE clause, ensuring that filtering happens early.

2. **Join Reordering**: Although the original query does not specify the order of joins, ensuring that smaller tables or the most restrictive filters are applied first can be beneficial. This is somewhat dependent on the database's query planner, but explicitly arranging joins can sometimes help.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query now uses explicit INNER JOIN syntax, which is clearer and more maintainable than the implicit joins used in the original query.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Grouping Attributes**: The GROUP BY clause has been checked to ensure it only includes necessary columns for the aggregation and matches the SELECT clause for the non-aggregated columns.

These changes should help in improving the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data shuffled and processed during the execution, and by making the query more readable and maintainable.
