To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving filter conditions as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: If a subquery or a derived table computation is repeated, it can be computed once and reused.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated.

4. **Using EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries**: This can be more efficient as EXISTS stops processing as soon as it finds the first matching record.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We push the condition `d_year = 2001` and `ca_state = 'TN'` directly into the subquery for `customer_total_return` to reduce the amount of data processed in the main query.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: The subquery calculating the average `ctr_total_return` is used twice in the main query. We can calculate it once and reuse the result.

3. **Using EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries**: Replace the subquery condition with an EXISTS clause to potentially improve performance.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
    SELECT 
        cr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
        ca_state AS ctr_state,
        SUM(cr_return_amt_inc_tax) AS ctr_total_return
    FROM 
        catalog_returns
        JOIN date_dim ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON cr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001 AND ca_state = 'TN'
    GROUP BY 
        cr_returning_customer_sk, ca_state
), avg_returns AS (
    SELECT 
        ctr_state, 
        AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_ctr_total_return
    FROM 
        customer_total_return
    GROUP BY 
        ctr_state
)
SELECT 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    ca_street_number,
    ca_street_name,
    ca_street_type,
    ca_suite_number,
    ca_city,
    ca_county,
    ca_state,
    ca_zip,
    ca_country,
    ca_gmt_offset,
    ca_location_type,
    ctr_total_return
FROM 
    customer_total_return ctr1
    JOIN customer_address ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
    JOIN customer ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
WHERE 
    ctr_total_return > (
        SELECT avg_ctr_total_return
        FROM avg_returns
        WHERE ctr1.ctr_state = avg_returns.ctr_state
    )
ORDER BY 
    c_customer_id, c_salutation, c_first_name, c_last_name, ca_street_number, ca_street_name, ca_street_type, ca_suite_number, ca_city, ca_county, ca_state, ca_zip, ca_country, ca_gmt_offset, ca_location_type, ctr_total_return
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query reduces the amount of data processed by filtering early in the subqueries and avoids recalculating the average return multiple times.
