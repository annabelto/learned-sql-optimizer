To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter conditions as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data scanned and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Join Reordering**: Adjusting the order of joins can significantly impact performance, especially in a system like PostgreSQL where different join methods (nested loops, hash join, merge join) have different performance characteristics.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (from the WHERE clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can improve readability and often gives the optimizer more information to work with, potentially leading to better execution plans.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Removing unnecessary columns from the SELECT and GROUP BY clauses can reduce the amount of data processed.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the conditions `i_manager_id=52`, `d_moy=11`, and `d_year=2000` directly into the respective table references.
2. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert the implicit joins in the WHERE clause to explicit JOINs.
3. **Join Reordering**: Although PostgreSQL's planner automatically determines the best join order during query execution, suggesting an optimal join order based on data size and filter selectivity can sometimes help. Here, we assume `item` and `date_dim` tables are smaller after applying filters and should be joined first.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
    i.i_brand AS brand, 
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM 
    item i
JOIN 
    store_sales ss ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_manager_id = 52 AND 
    d.d_moy = 11 AND 
    d.d_year = 2000
GROUP BY 
    i.i_brand, 
    i.i_brand_id
ORDER BY 
    ext_price DESC, 
    i.i_brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit JOINs**: The query now uses explicit JOIN syntax, which is generally clearer and can help the optimizer.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Filters are applied directly in the JOIN conditions or in the WHERE clause immediately after the relevant table is mentioned, which can help reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed later in the query.
- **Join Reordering**: The order of joins is suggested based on assumed table sizes and filter selectivity, though PostgreSQL's planner will ultimately decide the join order at execution time.

This rewritten query should be more efficient in terms of execution time compared to the original query, assuming typical data distributions and table sizes.
