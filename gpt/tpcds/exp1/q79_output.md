To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source to reduce the amount of data processed and transferred across the system.
2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Remove or simplify redundant expressions or conditions.
3. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if the join keys and filters guarantee that the join does not filter out rows or add columns.
4. **Projection Pushdown**: Reduce the number of columns in the intermediate results by pushing projections down the query plan.
5. **Use of IN instead of multiple ORs**: Simplify conditions using IN rather than multiple ORs for clarity and potential performance improvement.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple tables: `store_sales`, `date_dim`, `store`, `household_demographics`, and `customer`. It filters on several conditions and performs aggregations based on `ss_ticket_number`, `ss_customer_sk`, and `store.s_city`. The query also has a condition on `date_dim.d_year` using values (2000, 2001, 2002) and a range condition on `store.s_number_employees`.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: 
   - Push the conditions related to `date_dim` and `store` directly into the subquery where these tables are joined.
   - Push the conditions on `household_demographics` into the subquery.

2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**:
   - The condition `date_dim.d_year in (2000, 2000+1, 2000+2)` can be simplified to `date_dim.d_year in (2000, 2001, 2002)`.

3. **Projection Pushdown**:
   - Only select the necessary columns in the subquery to avoid carrying unnecessary data through the query plan.

4. **Join Elimination**:
   - Check if any joins can be eliminated based on the usage of the columns in the select and where clauses. However, in this query, all joins seem necessary due to the dependency on columns used in the select and where clauses.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    substr(s_city, 1, 30) AS city,
    ss_ticket_number,
    amt,
    profit
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        store.s_city,
        SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
    JOIN 
        household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    WHERE 
        (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 7 OR household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > -1)
        AND date_dim.d_dow = 1
        AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
        AND store.s_number_employees BETWEEN 200 AND 295
    GROUP BY 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        store.s_city
) AS ms
JOIN 
    customer ON ms.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    city,
    profit
LIMIT 100;
```

In this optimized query, we have applied predicate pushdown to ensure filters are applied early, simplified the year condition, and ensured only necessary columns are selected in the subquery. This should help in reducing the computation and memory overhead.
