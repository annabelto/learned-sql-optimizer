To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules applied here include:

1. **Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by extracting common subexpressions into a single expression that can be referenced multiple times. In this query, the subquery that determines the dates from `date_dim` is repeated in each main query block (`sr_items`, `cr_items`, `wr_items`). We can extract this into a single common table expression (CTE).

2. **Predicate Pushdown**: This optimization pushes predicates into subqueries or joins where possible, which can reduce the size of intermediate results and thus improve performance.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, it might be possible to eliminate it or replace it with a more efficient operation.

4. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify complex expressions where possible to reduce computation overhead.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH relevant_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_week_seq IN (
        SELECT d_week_seq
        FROM date_dim
        WHERE d_date IN ('2001-07-13', '2001-09-10', '2001-11-16')
    )
),
sr_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(sr_return_quantity) AS sr_item_qty
    FROM store_returns
    JOIN item ON sr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_date IN (SELECT d_date FROM relevant_dates)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
cr_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(cr_return_quantity) AS cr_item_qty
    FROM catalog_returns
    JOIN item ON cr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_date IN (SELECT d_date FROM relevant_dates)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
wr_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(wr_return_quantity) AS wr_item_qty
    FROM web_returns
    JOIN item ON wr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON wr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_date IN (SELECT d_date FROM relevant_dates)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT
    sr_items.item_id,
    sr_item_qty,
    sr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS sr_dev,
    cr_item_qty,
    cr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS cr_dev,
    wr_item_qty,
    wr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS wr_dev,
    (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 AS average
FROM sr_items
JOIN cr_items ON sr_items.item_id = cr_items.item_id
JOIN wr_items ON sr_items.item_id = wr_items.item_id
ORDER BY sr_items.item_id, sr_item_qty
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Common Subexpression Elimination**: The repeated subquery for dates is moved to a CTE named `relevant_dates`.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The condition `d_date IN (SELECT d_date FROM relevant_dates)` is pushed down into the join condition in each of the `sr_items`, `cr_items`, and `wr_items` CTEs.
- **Join and Expression Simplifications**: The joins are now more straightforward, and the expressions are simplified by directly using the results from the `relevant_dates` CTE.

These changes should make the query more efficient by reducing redundancy and the amount of data processed.
