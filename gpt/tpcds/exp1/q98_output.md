To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter conditions as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated. However, in this query, all joins seem necessary for the final output.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax. This makes the query easier to read and understand, and in some cases, can help the database optimize the join order.

4. **Date Operations Simplification**: Simplify the operations on dates if possible to make the conditions clearer and potentially more index-friendly.

5. **Column Pruning**: Ensure only necessary columns are fetched in each part of the query.

Let's apply these rules to the given query:

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ss_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    store_sales,
    item,
    date_dim
WHERE 
    ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
    AND i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Jewelry')
    AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-02-05' AS DATE) AND (CAST('1999-02-05' AS DATE) + 30)
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**:
   Convert the implicit joins to explicit joins for clarity and potential optimization.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   Push the category filter closer to the `item` table and the date filter closer to the `date_dim` table.

3. **Date Operations Simplification**:
   Pre-calculate the end date to simplify the date range condition.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ss_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Jewelry')
    AND d_date BETWEEN '1999-02-05'::date AND '1999-03-07'::date  -- Simplified date range
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio;
```

In this optimized query, explicit JOINs are used for clarity, and the date range is simplified by pre-calculating the end date. Predicate pushdown is implicitly handled by the restructuring of the JOINs and WHERE clause.
