To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, reduce the amount of data processed, and improve the execution plan generated by PostgreSQL. Here are the rules I will use and the order of their application:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates into subqueries to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant subquery expressions to avoid repeated calculations.
3. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not contribute to the final result.
4. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify or replace expressions for clarity and potential performance improvement.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple joins and subqueries checking for the existence of related sales in different tables (`store_sales`, `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`) within a specific date range. The query also filters on `ca_county` and groups results by several demographic attributes.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: 
   - Push the conditions related to `d_year` and `d_moy` directly into the subqueries for `store_sales`, `web_sales`, and `catalog_sales`. This reduces the data scanned in these tables.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**:
   - The date conditions `d_year = 2001 and d_moy between 3 and 6` are repeated across subqueries. We can keep them as is because each subquery refers to a different sales table, but ensure they are directly in the WHERE clause of each subquery.

3. **Join Elimination**:
   - All joins appear necessary for the final result as they link customer demographics and addresses with sales data.

4. **Simplifying Expressions**:
   - Replace `3+3` with `6` in the date range conditions for clarity.

```sql

    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    count(*) AS cnt1, 
    cd_purchase_estimate,

WHERE 
    ca_county IN ('Fairfield County', 'Campbell County', 'Washtenaw County', 'Escambia County', 'Cleburne County')
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM store_sales, date_dim
        WHERE c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk
        AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        AND d_year = 2001
        AND d_moy BETWEEN 3 AND 6
    )
    AND (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM web_sales, date_dim
            WHERE c.c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk
            AND ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
            AND d_year = 2001
            AND d_moy BETWEEN 3 AND 6
        )
        OR EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM catalog_sales, date_dim
            WHERE c.c_customer_sk = cs_ship_customer_sk
            AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
            AND d_year = 2001
            AND d_moy BETWEEN 3 AND 6
        )
    )
GROUP BY 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd_credit_rating, 
    cd_dep_count, 
    cd_dep_employed_count, 
    cd_dep_college_count 
ORDER BY 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd_credit_rating, 
    cd_dep_count, 
    cd_dep_employed_count, 
    cd_dep_college_count 
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data scanning and clearer expressions.
