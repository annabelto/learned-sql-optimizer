To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: If the same expression or subquery is used multiple times, it can be computed once and reused. This reduces computation.

3. **Use of Temporary Tables for Complex Subqueries**: Breaking down complex queries into simpler parts using temporary tables can make the query more manageable and often faster, as each part of the query can be optimized separately.

4. **Elimination of Distinct When Using Intersect**: Since the `INTERSECT` operation inherently eliminates duplicates across the combined datasets, the use of `DISTINCT` in the subqueries before an `INTERSECT` is redundant.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the `d_month_seq` filter closer to the table scans of `date_dim` in each subquery.
2. **Elimination of Distinct When Using Intersect**: Remove the `DISTINCT` keyword in the subqueries because `INTERSECT` will handle removing duplicates.
3. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Not directly applicable here as each subquery accesses different sales tables, but ensuring any reusable conditions or joins are optimized.
4. **Use of Temporary Tables for Complex Subqueries**: Not applied here directly in the rewrite below, but could be considered in further optimization steps depending on the execution environment and specific performance characteristics.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1200

    INTERSECT

    SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1200

    INTERSECT

    SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer ON web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1200
) hot_cust
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query should perform better due to the reduced number of rows processed by the early application of filters and the removal of unnecessary `DISTINCT` operations.
