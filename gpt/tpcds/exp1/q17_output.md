To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the query's performance without altering the data it accesses. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving filter conditions closer to the data source. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result set (i.e., it does not filter or add columns to the output), it can be eliminated.

3. **Column Pruning**: Only select the columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in join conditions, filtering, or aggregations.

4. **Redundant Group By Elimination**: If the grouping is redundant or can be derived from another unique grouping, it can be eliminated.

5. **Using IN instead of multiple ORs**: This makes the query more readable and can sometimes help the optimizer generate a better execution plan.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_state,
    COUNT(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantitycount,
    AVG(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantityave,
    STDDEV_SAMP(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantitystdev,
    STDDEV_SAMP(ss_quantity) / AVG(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantitycov,
    COUNT(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantitycount,
    AVG(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantityave,
    STDDEV_SAMP(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantitystdev,
    STDDEV_SAMP(sr_return_quantity) / AVG(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantitycov,
    COUNT(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantitycount,
    AVG(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantityave,
    STDDEV_SAMP(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantitystdev,
    STDDEV_SAMP(cs_quantity) / AVG(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantitycov
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
WHERE 
    d1.d_quarter_name = '2001Q1'
    AND d2.d_quarter_name IN ('2001Q1', '2001Q2', '2001Q3')
    AND d3.d_quarter_name IN ('2001Q1', '2001Q2', '2001Q3')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id, i_item_desc, s_state
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id, i_item_desc, s_state
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to move the date dimension filters closer to their respective joins.
- **Column Pruning**: Ensured that only necessary columns are selected.
- **Using IN instead of multiple ORs**: Simplified the conditions for `d2.d_quarter_name` and `d3.d_quarter_name`.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data shuffling and earlier application of filters, which minimizes the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
