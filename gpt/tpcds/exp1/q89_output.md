To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules include predicate pushdown, projection pruning, and using explicit joins instead of implicit joins. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. By applying filters early, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Projection Pruning**: This rule involves selecting only the columns that are necessary for the final output from each table, rather than selecting all columns with `*`.

3. **Use Explicit Joins**: Replace implicit joins (using WHERE for joining tables) with explicit JOIN syntax. This makes the query easier to read and often allows the database more flexibility in execution plan generation.

4. **Simplify CASE Expression**: Simplify the CASE expression in the WHERE clause for better readability and potentially better performance.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_category, 
    i_class, 
    i_brand, 
    s_store_name, 
    s_company_name, 
    d_moy, 
    sum_sales, 
    avg_monthly_sales
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_moy, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, 
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name) AS avg_monthly_sales
    FROM 
        item
        JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001
        AND (
            (i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('history', 'school-uniforms', 'audio'))
            OR (i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Shoes') AND i_class IN ('pants', 'tennis', 'womens'))
        )
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_moy
) AS tmp1
WHERE 
    (avg_monthly_sales <> 0 AND ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales > 0.1)
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit Joins**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit JOIN clauses for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the year and category/class filters directly into the JOIN conditions to reduce the amount of data processed.
- **Projection Pruning**: Removed the unnecessary `SELECT *` and specified only the required columns in the subquery and outer query.
- **Simplified CASE Expression**: Converted the CASE expression into a simpler WHERE clause condition, improving readability and potentially execution speed by avoiding unnecessary conditional logic evaluation.

These changes should help in improving the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data being processed and making the query execution plan more efficient.
