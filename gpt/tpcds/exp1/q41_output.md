To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that simplify and potentially improve the performance of the query. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Simplification**: Simplify the conditions in the WHERE clause to make them more readable and potentially more efficient for the query planner.
2. **Constant Expression Reduction**: Evaluate expressions that can be computed at compile time.
3. **Subquery Flattening**: Convert the correlated subquery into a join if possible, which can be more efficiently executed by the database engine.
4. **Elimination of Redundant DISTINCT**: Check if the DISTINCT is necessary based on the query structure.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query uses a correlated subquery to filter items based on complex conditions related to product characteristics and counts. The DISTINCT clause is used, potentially to eliminate duplicates resulting from the subquery conditions.

### Step-by-Step Optimization

#### Step 1: Constant Expression Reduction
The expression `704 + 40` can be precomputed.

#### Step 2: Predicate Simplification
The conditions inside the subquery are quite complex but repetitive across different categories and can be grouped more efficiently.

#### Step 3: Subquery Flattening
We can attempt to flatten the subquery by transforming it into a join, although the use of `count(*) > 0` makes it a bit tricky. We can use EXISTS instead of a subquery with COUNT, which directly checks for the existence of rows satisfying the conditions, potentially improving performance.

#### Step 4: Elimination of Redundant DISTINCT
If the join conditions and the WHERE clause guarantee unique `i_product_name`, the DISTINCT might be redundant. However, without knowing the data distribution and without unique constraints, it's safer to keep the DISTINCT.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT i1.i_product_name
FROM item i1
JOIN item i2 ON i1.i_manufact = i2.i_manufact
WHERE i1.i_manufact_id BETWEEN 704 AND 744
AND (
    (i2.i_category = 'Women' AND i2.i_color IN ('forest', 'lime', 'navy', 'slate', 'dark', 'aquamarine', 'frosted', 'plum') AND i2.i_units IN ('Pallet', 'Pound', 'Gross', 'Bunch', 'Ton', 'Tbl', 'Dram', 'Box') AND i2.i_size IN ('economy', 'small', 'extra large', 'petite'))
    OR
    (i2.i_category = 'Men' AND i2.i_color IN ('powder', 'sky', 'maroon', 'smoke', 'papaya', 'peach', 'firebrick', 'sienna') AND i2.i_units IN ('Dozen', 'Lb', 'Ounce', 'Case', 'Bundle', 'Carton', 'Cup', 'Each') AND i2.i_size IN ('N/A', 'large', 'economy', 'small'))
)
GROUP BY i1.i_product_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
ORDER BY i1.i_product_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation
- **Constant Expression Reduction**: `704 + 40` is simplified to `744`.
- **Predicate Simplification**: Grouped similar conditions together and used IN for simplification.
- **Subquery Flattening**: Converted the correlated subquery into a join and used GROUP BY and HAVING to ensure the count condition is met.
- **Distinct**: Kept DISTINCT as we cannot guarantee uniqueness without further schema details.

This rewritten query should be more efficient while maintaining the same logical output as the original query.
