To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Remove duplicate expressions in the query to simplify processing.
3. **Use Explicit JOINs Instead of WHERE for Clarity and Performance**: Convert implicit joins in the WHERE clause to explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
4. **Column Pruning**: Only select columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in JOINs, WHERE, or GROUP BY clauses.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple tables and has conditions that can be pushed closer to the source tables. It also uses implicit JOINs through the WHERE clause, which can be converted to explicit JOINs for better clarity.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    c.c_last_name,
    c.c_first_name,
    current_addr.ca_city,
    dn.bought_city,
    dn.ss_ticket_number,
    dn.amt,
    dn.profit
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    customer_address current_addr ON c.c_current_addr_sk = current_addr.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    (SELECT 
         ss.ss_ticket_number,
         ss.ss_customer_sk,
         ca.ca_city AS bought_city,
         SUM(ss.ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
         SUM(ss.ss_net_profit) AS profit
     FROM 
         store_sales ss
     JOIN 
         date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
     JOIN 
         store s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
     JOIN 
         household_demographics hd ON ss.ss_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
     JOIN 
         customer_address ca ON ss.ss_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
     WHERE 
         (hd.hd_dep_count = 8 OR hd.hd_vehicle_count = 0)
         AND d.d_dow IN (6, 0)
         AND d.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
         AND s.s_city IN ('Midway', 'Fairview')
     GROUP BY 
         ss.ss_ticket_number, ss.ss_customer_sk, ca.ca_city
    ) dn ON c.c_customer_sk = dn.ss_customer_sk
WHERE 
    current_addr.ca_city <> dn.bought_city
ORDER BY 
    c.c_last_name, c.c_first_name, current_addr.ca_city, dn.bought_city, dn.ss_ticket_number
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Explicit JOINs**: The query now uses explicit JOINs instead of combining tables using the WHERE clause. This makes the query easier to read and understand.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions related to specific tables are moved into the JOIN conditions or directly into the subquery where the tables are first accessed.
- **Column Pruning**: Removed unnecessary columns from the SELECT list in the subquery, keeping only those needed for the final output or conditions.
- **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Removed duplicate city names in the list for `s.s_city`.

These changes should help in improving the execution efficiency of the query by reducing the amount of data shuffled between operations and making better use of indexes.
