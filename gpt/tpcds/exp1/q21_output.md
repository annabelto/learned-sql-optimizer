To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into subqueries or joins where possible to reduce the number of rows processed in the higher levels of the query.
2. **Projection Pruning**: Limit the columns retrieved in the subquery to only those necessary for the final output or conditions.
3. **Join Reordering**: Although not always directly controllable in PostgreSQL, logical suggestions for join order based on the size of intermediate results can be considered.
4. **Use of Explicit Casting**: Minimize the use of casting where not necessary or ensure it's done in the most efficient manner.
5. **Simplification of Expressions**: Simplify or reorganize expressions for clarity and potential performance improvement.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple joins and a subquery with aggregation. The filtering conditions on `i_current_price` and `d_date` can be pushed down to reduce the size of intermediate results. Also, the casting of `d_date` can be simplified by using a constant date value.

### Applying Rewrite Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Push the conditions on `i_current_price` and `d_date` directly into the subquery to reduce the amount of data joined and aggregated.
2. **Projection Pruning**: Only select the necessary columns in the innermost subquery.
3. **Simplification of Expressions**: Use a constant for the date '1999-06-22' to avoid repeated casting.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    w_warehouse_name,
    i_item_id,
    inv_before,
    inv_after
FROM (
    SELECT 
        w_warehouse_name,
        i_item_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN d_date < DATE '1999-06-22' THEN inv_quantity_on_hand ELSE 0 END) AS inv_before,
        SUM(CASE WHEN d_date >= DATE '1999-06-22' THEN inv_quantity_on_hand ELSE 0 END) AS inv_after
    FROM 
        inventory
    JOIN 
        warehouse ON inv_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
    JOIN 
        item ON i_item_sk = inv_item_sk
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON inv_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
        AND d_date BETWEEN DATE '1999-06-22' - INTERVAL '30 days' AND DATE '1999-06-22' + INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY 
        w_warehouse_name, i_item_id
) x
WHERE 
    (CASE WHEN inv_before > 0 THEN inv_after / inv_before ELSE NULL END) BETWEEN 2.0/3.0 AND 3.0/2.0
ORDER BY 
    w_warehouse_name, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `i_current_price` and `d_date` are included in the subquery to reduce the amount of data processed in the joins and aggregation.
- **Projection Pruning**: Only necessary columns are selected in the subquery.
- **Simplification of Expressions**: The date '1999-06-22' is used directly without casting each time, which simplifies the query and may improve performance by reducing computation overhead.
