To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not affect the result.
3. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Replace implicit joins in the WHERE clause with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and potentially more efficient execution plans.
4. **Elimination of Redundant Group By**: If the grouping columns are functionally dependent on the primary keys or unique columns, the GROUP BY clause might be simplified or removed.
5. **Limit Pushdown**: Apply the LIMIT clause as early as possible to reduce the size of the result set early in the execution.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query joins several tables and filters on various attributes. It also groups the results by certain item attributes and applies a LIMIT to the final output.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We push predicates related to `inventory`, `date_dim`, and `item` directly into the respective JOIN conditions to reduce the number of rows joined and processed.

2. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

3. **Join Elimination**: After reviewing the query, all joins seem necessary for the final result, so no joins can be eliminated.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Group By**: The columns in the GROUP BY clause (`i_item_id`, `i_item_desc`, `i_current_price`) are directly selected, and assuming `i_item_id` could be a unique or primary key, the GROUP BY might be redundant. However, without schema details confirming `i_item_id` uniqueness, we'll keep the GROUP BY.

5. **Limit Pushdown**: The LIMIT is already at the lowest level it can be, given the ordering requirement.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_current_price
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    inventory ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk AND inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
JOIN 
    date_dim ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-03-29' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-03-29' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 days')
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE 
    i_current_price BETWEEN 29 AND 59
    AND i_manufact_id IN (705, 742, 777, 944)
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation
- **Explicit JOINs** are used instead of listing all tables in the FROM clause and using WHERE for joining conditions.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions related to specific tables are moved into the respective JOIN clauses.
- The **GROUP BY** and **LIMIT** clauses remain unchanged as they are necessary for the correct result set and are already optimized given the query requirements.
