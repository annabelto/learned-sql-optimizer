To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the semantics of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data processed by filtering rows early in the execution plan.
2. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to reduce the size of intermediate results. This can be particularly effective if smaller tables or the results of filtering operations are joined earlier.
3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control over join conditions.
4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Remove columns from the SELECT clause that are not needed for the final output or in subsequent processing.
5. **Limit Pushdown**: If possible, push the LIMIT operation closer to the data retrieval stage to reduce the amount of data transported and processed.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    s.s_store_name,
    s.s_company_id,
    s.s_street_number,
    s.s_street_name,
    s.s_street_type,
    s.s_suite_number,
    s.s_city,
    s.s_county,
    s.s_state,
    s.s_zip,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk > 30) AND (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk <= 60) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk > 60) AND (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk <= 90) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk > 90) AND (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk <= 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr.sr_returned_date_sk - ss.ss_sold_date_sk > 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM 
    store_sales ss
JOIN 
    store_returns sr ON ss.ss_ticket_number = sr.sr_ticket_number AND ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk AND ss.ss_customer_sk = sr.sr_customer_sk
JOIN 
    store s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d2.d_year = 2001 AND d2.d_moy = 8
GROUP BY 
    s.s_store_name, s.s_company_id, s.s_street_number, s.s_street_name, s.s_street_type, s.s_suite_number, s.s_city, s.s_county, s.s_state, s.s_zip
ORDER BY 
    s.s_store_name, s.s_company_id, s.s_street_number, s.s_street_name, s.s_street_type, s.s_suite_number, s.s_city, s.s_county, s.s_state, s.s_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

In this optimized query:
- I used explicit JOINs instead of listing tables in the FROM clause.
- I applied predicate pushdown by moving the conditions on `d2.d_year` and `d2.d_moy` directly into the JOIN condition with `date_dim d2`.
- The query structure is reorganized for better readability and potential performance improvements through join reordering.
