To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: The subquery to determine the `d_week_seq` for a specific date ('2001-06-16') is repeated in each main subquery (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). We can compute this once and reuse the result.

2. **Join Elimination**: Instead of using `IN` with a subquery, we can join directly on the condition derived from the subquery, which simplifies the execution plan and potentially uses indexes more efficiently.

3. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to where the data originates, which can reduce the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.

4. **Simplifying Expressions**: The expressions for `ss_dev`, `cs_dev`, and `ws_dev` are recalculated multiple times. We can compute the average once and reuse it in the calculation.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH week_seq AS (
    SELECT d_week_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date = '2001-06-16'
),
ss_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id,
           SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ss_item_rev
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_week_seq = (SELECT d_week_seq FROM week_seq)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
cs_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id,
           SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS cs_item_rev
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_week_seq = (SELECT d_week_seq FROM week_seq)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
ws_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id,
           SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS ws_item_rev
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_week_seq = (SELECT d_week_seq FROM week_seq)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
combined AS (
    SELECT ss_items.item_id,
           ss_item_rev,
           cs_item_rev,
           ws_item_rev,
           (ss_item_rev + cs_item_rev + ws_item_rev) / 3 AS average
    FROM ss_items
    JOIN cs_items USING (item_id)
    JOIN ws_items USING (item_id)
    WHERE ss_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * cs_item_rev AND 1.1 * cs_item_rev
      AND ss_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ws_item_rev AND 1.1 * ws_item_rev
      AND cs_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ss_item_rev AND 1.1 * ss_item_rev
      AND cs_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ws_item_rev AND 1.1 * ws_item_rev
      AND ws_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * ss_item_rev AND 1.1 * ss_item_rev
      AND ws_item_rev BETWEEN 0.9 * cs_item_rev AND 1.1 * cs_item_rev
)
SELECT item_id,
       ss_item_rev,
       ss_item_rev / average * 100 AS ss_dev,
       cs_item_rev,
       cs_item_rev / average * 100 AS cs_dev,
       ws_item_rev,
       ws_item_rev / average * 100 AS ws_dev,
       average
FROM combined
ORDER BY item_id, ss_item_rev
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query reduces redundancy and should perform better due to more efficient use of joins and computation reuse.
