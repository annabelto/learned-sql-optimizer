To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates (filter conditions) as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the number of rows processed in the joins by filtering out unnecessary data early in the execution plan.

2. **Remove Redundant Order By**: Since the query uses an aggregate function (`count(*)`) without a `GROUP BY` clause, the `ORDER BY count(*)` is redundant because there will only be a single aggregate value returned. Removing this will simplify the execution plan.

3. **Limit Pushdown**: If applicable, pushing the `LIMIT` clause down can reduce the amount of data processed. However, in this case, since the `LIMIT` applies to a single aggregated result, it doesn't change the execution but clarifies intent.

Here's how the optimized query looks after applying these rules:

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM store_sales
JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
JOIN time_dim ON ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk
JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
WHERE time_dim.t_hour = 8
  AND time_dim.t_minute >= 30
  AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 0
  AND store.s_store_name = 'ese'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: All conditions are directly linked to their respective tables in the `WHERE` clause, which helps in filtering data at the earliest possible stage in each table involved.
- **Remove Redundant Order By**: The `ORDER BY count(*)` clause has been removed because it does not affect the result in this specific case of a single aggregate function without grouping.
- **Limit Pushdown**: The `LIMIT 100` remains, but it's more of a formality here since `COUNT(*)` will return a single row. This could be useful if the query is adjusted later to return individual rows or is part of a larger union or complex query.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage by minimizing the amount of data being processed and transferred across the joins and by eliminating unnecessary sorting operations.
