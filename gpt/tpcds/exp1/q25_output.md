To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the performance without altering the semantics of the query. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated. This is not directly applicable here as all joins seem necessary based on the given conditions.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This improves readability and potentially allows the database engine to better optimize the query execution plan.

4. **Reduction of Search Space via Early Aggregation**: If possible, performing aggregation earlier can reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name,
    MAX(ss_net_profit) AS store_sales_profit,
    MAX(sr_net_loss) AS store_returns_loss,
    MAX(cs_net_profit) AS catalog_sales_profit
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    store_sales ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk
    AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
    AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk
    AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
    AND d1.d_moy = 4
    AND d1.d_year = 1999
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
    AND d2.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10
    AND d2.d_year = 1999
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
    AND d3.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10
    AND d3.d_year = 1999
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the conditions related to `date_dim` directly into the respective `JOIN` clauses. This reduces the amount of data flowing into the joins by filtering early.
- **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit joins (comma-separated) to explicit JOIN operations, which are clearer and often preferred for complex queries.
- **Early Aggregation**: This query does not allow for moving aggregation up without changing the logic, as the aggregation is dependent on the results of multiple tables being joined.

These changes should help in optimizing the query execution by reducing the amount of data processed and clarifying the join conditions, which can help the database optimizer to create a more efficient execution plan.
