To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data processed by filtering rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify or pre-compute constant expressions to reduce the complexity of the query.

3. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to minimize the size of intermediate results, which can reduce the cost of join operations.

4. **Use of Proper Join Types**: Change the join types if possible to more efficient ones based on the data distribution and size.

5. **Eliminate Redundant Casts**: Remove unnecessary casts if the data types are already compatible.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    w_state,
    i_item_id,
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN d_date < DATE '2001-05-02' THEN cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0)
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS sales_before,
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN d_date >= DATE '2001-05-02' THEN cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0)
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS sales_after
FROM 
    catalog_sales
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    catalog_returns ON cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk
JOIN 
    warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
    AND d_date BETWEEN DATE '2001-05-02' - INTERVAL '30 days' AND DATE '2001-05-02' + INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 
    w_state, i_item_id
ORDER BY 
    w_state, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `i_current_price` and `d_date` are pushed down in the `WHERE` clause to filter rows as early as possible.
- **Simplify Expressions**: The casting of `'2001-05-02'` to date is simplified by directly using `DATE '2001-05-02'` and using `INTERVAL` for date arithmetic.
- **Join Reordering**: Although the original query does not specify a join order that can be changed without knowing the data distribution, ensuring that smaller tables or those with more restrictive filters are joined earlier could be beneficial. This is generally handled by the query optimizer.
- **Use of Proper Join Types**: The left join is necessary due to the nature of the data (matching sales with potential returns), but ensuring that other joins are inner joins helps in reducing the dataset early.
- **Eliminate Redundant Casts**: Removed redundant casts of `d_date` as it is already being joined on `date_dim` which ensures it is a date.

These optimizations aim to reduce the amount of data being processed and the complexity of the operations, potentially leading to faster query execution times.
