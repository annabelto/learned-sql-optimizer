To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subquery or on the join condition to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution.
2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not contribute to the final result.
3. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify or replace expressions for clarity and potential performance improvement.
4. **Using IN instead of BETWEEN for single values**: This can sometimes simplify the execution plan and make the intention clearer.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query joins multiple tables and filters data based on specific conditions related to dates and other attributes. It also groups the results by several columns and calculates maximum values for different quantities.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
We can push predicates related to the `date_dim` table directly into the join condition to reduce the number of rows early.

#### Step 2: Simplifying Expressions
The expression `d2.d_moy between 4 and 4 + 3` can be simplified to `d2.d_moy between 4 and 7`. Similarly, `d3.d_year in (1998, 1998+1, 1998+2)` can be simplified to `d3.d_year in (1998, 1999, 2000)`.

#### Step 3: Using IN instead of BETWEEN for single values
The condition `d2.d_moy between 4 and 4` is effectively `d2.d_moy = 4`, so we can use `IN` for clarity.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name,
    MAX(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantity,
    MAX(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantity,
    MAX(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantity
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk
                   AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
                   AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk
                   AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
                AND d1.d_moy = 4
                AND d1.d_year = 1998
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
                AND d2.d_moy IN (4, 5, 6, 7)
                AND d2.d_year = 1998
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
                AND d3.d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation
- **Joins**: The joins are now explicit, making the query easier to understand and allowing the database engine to optimize the join order and method.
- **Predicates**: Conditions are pushed closer to their relevant tables, reducing the amount of data processed in later stages of the query.
- **Simplifications**: The date conditions are simplified for clarity and potential performance benefits.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data shuffling and clearer execution paths for the database optimizer.
