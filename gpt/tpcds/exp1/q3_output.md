To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter conditions as close as possible to the data source. By applying filters early, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Use of Explicit JOINs**: Replacing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it makes the join conditions clearer and allows the database engine to optimize the join order and type more effectively.

3. **Selectivity Consideration**: Rearranging join order based on the selectivity of the join conditions. More selective joins (those that filter out more rows) should be performed earlier.

Here's the original query:

```sql
SELECT dt.d_year,
       item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
       item.i_brand AS brand,
       SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg
FROM date_dim dt, store_sales, item
WHERE dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
  AND store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
  AND item.i_manufact_id = 816
  AND dt.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY dt.d_year, item.i_brand, item.i_brand_id
ORDER BY dt.d_year, sum_agg DESC, brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT dt.d_year,
       item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
       item.i_brand AS brand,
       SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg
FROM date_dim dt
INNER JOIN store_sales ON dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
INNER JOIN item ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
WHERE item.i_manufact_id = 816
  AND dt.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY dt.d_year, item.i_brand, item.i_brand_id
ORDER BY dt.d_year, sum_agg DESC, brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions `item.i_manufact_id = 816` and `dt.d_moy = 11` are kept in the WHERE clause to filter rows as early as possible.

2. **Use of Explicit JOINs**: The query now uses explicit INNER JOINs instead of commas in the FROM clause. This clarifies the relationships between the tables and can help the database optimizer understand the query structure better.

3. **Selectivity Consideration**: Although not explicitly rearranged in this query due to lack of specific statistics in the prompt, typically, you would analyze which join or condition eliminates more rows and try to apply it earlier in the query processing.

These changes should help in improving the performance of the query by making better use of indexes and reducing the number of rows processed in the later stages of the query execution.
