To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules I will apply include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates into the subqueries to reduce the amount of data processed and joined in the later stages of the query.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries.
3. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify or reorganize expressions for clarity and potential performance improvement.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query consists of three main subqueries (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`) that are unioned together and then aggregated. Each subquery joins several tables and filters on dates and other conditions.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown
We push relevant predicates into the subqueries to reduce the volume of data:

- Move date and price conditions into the respective subqueries.
- Ensure that joins are only performed on necessary rows.

#### 2. Common Sub-expression Elimination
- The date range calculation `cast('2002-08-14' as date) + 30` is repeated; compute it once and reuse.

#### 3. Simplifying Expressions
- Simplify the concatenation in the final SELECT to make it clearer.

SELECT 
    channel, 
    id, 
    SUM(sales) AS sales, 
    SUM(returns) AS returns, 
    SUM(profit) AS profit 
FROM (
    SELECT 'store channel' AS channel, 'store' || store_id AS id, sales, returns, profit FROM ssr
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'catalog channel' AS channel, 'catalog_page' || catalog_page_id AS id, sales, returns, profit FROM csr
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'web channel' AS channel, 'web_site' || web_site_id AS id, sales, returns, profit FROM wsr
) x 
GROUP BY ROLLUP (channel, id) 
ORDER BY channel, id 
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data processing in each subquery and more efficient use of joins and filters.
