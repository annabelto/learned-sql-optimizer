To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Subquery Flattening**: This rule attempts to convert subqueries into joins or inline views when possible, which can be more efficiently executed by the database.

3. **Removing Distinct in Subqueries**: When used in a subquery that is part of an expression (like in a `WHERE` clause), the `DISTINCT` keyword might not affect the outcome but can add overhead.

4. **Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: This can make the query more readable and sometimes improve performance by materializing the subquery results.

5. **Index Suggestion**: Although not directly a rewrite rule, suggesting the use of indexes can significantly improve query performance. This is more of a recommendation rather than a rewrite.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the conditions on `date_dim` and `item` closer to their respective table sources in the joins.
2. **Removing Distinct in Subqueries**: The subquery for `d_month_seq` uses `DISTINCT` unnecessarily because it's compared in a scalar context (`=`).
3. **Subquery Flattening**: The subquery calculating the average price in `item` can be rewritten using a join.
4. **Use of CTEs**: Define CTEs for the subqueries to make the main query cleaner and potentially more efficient.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH month_seq AS (
    SELECT d_month_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
    LIMIT 1 -- Since only one value is needed, LIMIT 1 can be used instead of DISTINCT
),
avg_price AS (
    SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) AS avg_price
    FROM item
    GROUP BY i_category
)
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM customer_address a
JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
JOIN store_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
JOIN date_dim d ON s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN month_seq ON d.d_month_seq = month_seq.d_month_seq
JOIN avg_price ap ON i.i_category = ap.i_category
WHERE i.i_current_price > 1.2 * ap.avg_price
GROUP BY a.ca_state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **CTEs (`month_seq` and `avg_price`)**: These common table expressions simplify the main query and ensure that the subquery results are calculated only once.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions related to `date_dim` and `item` are moved closer to where these tables are accessed.
- **Removed `DISTINCT`**: In the `month_seq` CTE, `LIMIT 1` is used instead of `DISTINCT` since only one value is needed.
- **Subquery Flattening**: The average price calculation is moved into a CTE, which is then joined with the main query, avoiding a correlated subquery.

This rewritten query should perform better due to more efficient use of joins and reduction in the amount of data scanned and processed.
