To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subquery to reduce the number of rows processed in the outer query and during joins.
2. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify the expression used in the `d_month_seq` filter.
3. **Join Elimination**: If possible, eliminate unnecessary joins that do not affect the result.
4. **Use of Proper Join Types**: Change implicit joins to explicit joins for better readability and potentially more efficient execution plans.
5. **Column Pruning**: Select only the necessary columns in the subquery to reduce the amount of data processed.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple tables: `item`, `store_sales`, `date_dim`, and `store`. It filters on several columns and calculates aggregates with a window function. The query also uses a complex `CASE` statement in the outer query's `WHERE` clause.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
Push conditions related to `d_month_seq` and item properties directly into the subquery to reduce the dataset early.

#### Step 2: Simplify Expressions
The expression `d_month_seq in (1222,1222+1,...,1222+11)` can be simplified to `d_month_seq BETWEEN 1222 AND 1233`.

#### Step 3: Use of Proper Join Types
Convert implicit joins (comma-separated) to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

#### Step 4: Column Pruning
Only select necessary columns in the subquery to reduce data movement.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_manager_id,
    sum_sales,
    avg_monthly_sales
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_manager_id,
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) AS avg_monthly_sales
    FROM 
        item
        JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1222 AND 1233
        AND (
            (i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help') AND i_brand IN ('scholaramalgamalg #14', 'scholaramalgamalg #7', 'exportiunivamalg #9', 'scholaramalgamalg #9'))
            OR
            (i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men') AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants') AND i_brand IN ('amalgimporto #1', 'edu packscholar #1', 'exportiimporto #1', 'importoamalg #1'))
        )
    GROUP BY 
        i_manager_id
) AS tmp1
WHERE 
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales 
        ELSE NULL 
    END > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    i_manager_id,
    avg_monthly_sales,
    sum_sales
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query should perform better due to reduced data processing and clearer join conditions.
