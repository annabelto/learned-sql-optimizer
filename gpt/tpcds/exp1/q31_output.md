To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the rules and the order in which they are applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subqueries (CTEs) to reduce the size of the data that needs to be processed in the main query.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries.
3. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if the join keys and filters guarantee identical results.
4. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify complex expressions where possible, especially in the SELECT and WHERE clauses.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query uses two common table expressions (CTEs), `ss` and `ws`, to aggregate sales data from `store_sales` and `web_sales` respectively. It then performs a self-join on these CTEs to compare sales across different quarters of the same year.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown
We can push the conditions on `d_qoy` and `d_year` into the CTEs to reduce the amount of data aggregated and joined.

#### 2. Common Sub-expression Elimination
The conditions on `d_year = 1999` and matching `ca_county` across different aliases of `ss` and `ws` are repeated. We can simplify by ensuring these conditions are checked once in the CTEs.

#### 3. Join Elimination
Not applicable as all joins are necessary for the final result.

#### 4. Simplifying Expressions
The CASE statements in the WHERE clause can be simplified by directly using the conditions in the JOIN or WHERE clause, reducing complexity.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH ss AS (
    SELECT ca_county, d_qoy, d_year, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS store_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE d_year = 1999
    GROUP BY ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
),
ws AS (
    SELECT ca_county, d_qoy, d_year, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS web_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE d_year = 1999
    GROUP BY ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
)
SELECT ss1.ca_county,
       ss1.d_year,
       ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales AS web_q1_q2_increase,
       ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales AS store_q1_q2_increase,
       ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales AS web_q2_q3_increase,
       ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales AS store_q2_q3_increase
FROM ss ss1
JOIN ss ss2 ON ss1.ca_county = ss2.ca_county AND ss1.d_qoy = 1 AND ss2.d_qoy = 2
JOIN ss ss3 ON ss2.ca_county = ss3.ca_county AND ss3.d_qoy = 3
JOIN ws ws1 ON ss1.ca_county = ws1.ca_county AND ws1.d_qoy = 1
JOIN ws ws2 ON ws1.ca_county = ws2.ca_county AND ws2.d_qoy = 2
JOIN ws ws3 ON ws2.ca_county = ws3.ca_county AND ws3.d_qoy = 3
WHERE ws1.web_sales > 0 AND ws2.web_sales > 0 AND ws3.web_sales > 0
  AND ss1.store_sales > 0 AND ss2.store_sales > 0 AND ss3.store_sales > 0
  AND ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales > ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales
  AND ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales > ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales
ORDER BY store_q2_q3_increase;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data processing in the CTEs and simplified conditions in the main query.
