To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include predicate pushdown, join reordering, and using explicit joins instead of implicit joins. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Explicit Join Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated tables) with explicit JOIN syntax. This improves readability and can help the query planner optimize the joins more effectively.

3. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to ensure that smaller result sets are produced early and filtered down in subsequent joins. This can reduce the overall cost of the join operation.

4. **Date Calculation Optimization**: Pre-calculate the date range outside the query to avoid repeated calculations.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH date_range AS (
    SELECT 
        cast('2001-06-15' as date) AS start_date,
        (cast('2001-06-15' as date) + interval '30 days') AS end_date
)
SELECT 
    i.i_item_id,
    i.i_item_desc,
    i.i_category,
    i.i_class,
    i.i_current_price,
    SUM(ws.ws_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ws.ws_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ws.ws_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i.i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    web_sales ws
JOIN 
    item i ON ws.ws_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_range dr ON d.d_date BETWEEN dr.start_date AND dr.end_date
WHERE 
    i.i_category IN ('Men', 'Books', 'Electronics')
GROUP BY 
    i.i_item_id, i.i_item_desc, i.i_category, i.i_class, i.i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i.i_category, i.i_class, i.i_item_id, i.i_item_desc, revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: The filter on `i_category` is applied directly in the `WHERE` clause, reducing the number of rows joined.
- **Explicit Join Syntax**: The query now uses explicit `JOIN` syntax, which is generally more readable and can be more efficiently optimized by the query planner.
- **Join Reordering**: The joins are reordered to filter the date dimension early using a pre-computed date range in a CTE (`date_range`), which reduces the amount of data processed in the subsequent joins.
- **Date Calculation Optimization**: The date range is calculated once in the CTE, avoiding repeated calculations in the main query.

These optimizations should help improve the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data processed and making better use of indexes and join strategies.
