To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates into subqueries or joins where possible to reduce the size of intermediate results.
2. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant subquery expressions to avoid repeated calculations.
3. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not contribute to the final result.
4. **Using EXISTS instead of IN for subquery checks**: This can be more efficient as it stops processing as soon as a match is found.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple joins and subqueries, particularly checking for `ws_order_number` in two different subqueries which can be optimized.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: 
   - Push the conditions related to `web_sales`, `date_dim`, and `customer_address` directly into the respective joins and subqueries.
   
2. **Common Subexpression Elimination**:
   - The subquery `ws_wh` is used multiple times. We can simplify this by using a single instance of the subquery and referencing it as needed.

3. **Using EXISTS instead of IN**:
   - Convert the `IN` subquery conditions to `EXISTS` for better performance.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH ws_wh AS (
    SELECT ws1.ws_order_number
    FROM web_sales ws1
    JOIN web_sales ws2 ON ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
    WHERE ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number) AS "order count",
    SUM(ws1.ws_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
    SUM(ws1.ws_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM 
    web_sales ws1
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    web_site ws ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = ws.web_site_sk
WHERE 
    d.d_date BETWEEN '2001-4-01' AND (CAST('2001-4-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 days')
    AND ca.ca_state = 'VA'
    AND ws.web_company_name = 'pri'
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM ws_wh
        WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws_wh.ws_order_number
    )
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM web_returns wr
        WHERE wr.wr_order_number = ws1.ws_order_number
    )
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions related to dates, addresses, and websites are pushed closer to their respective table references.
- **Common Subexpression Elimination**: The `ws_wh` subquery is simplified and used directly in the `EXISTS` clauses.
- **Using EXISTS instead of IN**: This change helps in potentially reducing the amount of data scanned and processed by stopping as soon as a match is found.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data scanning and processing, and more efficient use of joins and subqueries.
