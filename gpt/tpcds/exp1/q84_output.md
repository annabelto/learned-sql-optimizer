To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to reduce the size of intermediate results, which can decrease query execution time.
3. **Projection Pushdown**: Limit the columns retrieved as early as possible in the query processing to reduce the amount of data being handled.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT c_customer_id AS customer_id,
       COALESCE(c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM customer,
     customer_address,
     customer_demographics,
     household_demographics,
     income_band,
     store_returns
WHERE ca_city = 'Woodland'
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ib_lower_bound >= 60306
  AND ib_upper_bound <= 60306 + 50000
  AND ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
  AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
  AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
  AND sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   - Push the predicates related to `customer_address` (`ca_city = 'Woodland'` and `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk`) closer to the `customer_address` table.
   - Push the predicates related to `income_band` (`ib_lower_bound >= 60306` and `ib_upper_bound <= 60306 + 50000`) closer to the `income_band` table.

2. **Join Reordering**:
   - Since `customer_address` and `income_band` have filters applied directly to them, join these tables first to reduce the size of the result set early in the query processing.

3. **Projection Pushdown**:
   - Only select the necessary columns from each table early in the query to reduce the amount of data being processed.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT c_customer_id AS customer_id,
       COALESCE(c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM (
    SELECT c_customer_id, c_last_name, c_first_name, c_current_cdemo_sk, c_current_hdemo_sk, c_current_addr_sk
    FROM customer
) c
JOIN (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_city = 'Woodland'
) ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
JOIN (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk, c_current_cdemo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
) cd ON c.c_current_cdemo_sk = cd.cd_demo_sk
JOIN (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk, hd_income_band_sk
    FROM household_demographics
) hd ON c.c_current_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
JOIN (
    SELECT ib_income_band_sk
    FROM income_band
    WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 60306 AND ib_upper_bound <= 60306 + 50000
) ib ON hd.hd_income_band_sk = ib.ib_income_band_sk
JOIN (
    SELECT sr_cdemo_sk
    FROM store_returns
) sr ON cd.cd_demo_sk = sr.sr_cdemo_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query should perform better due to reduced data processing and more efficient joins.
