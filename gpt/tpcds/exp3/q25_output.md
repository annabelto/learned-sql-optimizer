To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the query's performance by restructuring it without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. By applying filters early, we reduce the size of intermediate results, which can significantly speed up query execution.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to minimize the size of intermediate results. Efficient join ordering can be crucial for performance, especially in a query involving multiple joins.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can improve readability and often gives the optimizer better clues on how to optimize the joins.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Removing unnecessary columns from SELECT and JOIN clauses can reduce the amount of data processed.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_item_id,
    i.i_item_desc,
    s.s_store_id,
    s.s_store_name,
    MAX(ss.ss_net_profit) AS store_sales_profit,
    MAX(sr.sr_net_loss) AS store_returns_loss,
    MAX(cs.cs_net_profit) AS catalog_sales_profit
FROM 
    item i
JOIN 
    store_sales ss ON i.i_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk
JOIN 
    store s ON s.s_store_sk = ss.ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    store_returns sr ON ss.ss_customer_sk = sr.sr_customer_sk
                      AND ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk
                      AND ss.ss_ticket_number = sr.sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    catalog_sales cs ON sr.sr_customer_sk = cs.cs_bill_customer_sk
                      AND sr.sr_item_sk = cs.cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    d1.d_moy = 4 
    AND d1.d_year = 1999
    AND d2.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10
    AND d2.d_year = 1999
    AND d3.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10
    AND d3.d_year = 1999
GROUP BY 
    i.i_item_id,
    i.i_item_desc,
    s.s_store_id,
    s.s_store_name
ORDER BY 
    i.i_item_id,
    i.i_item_desc,
    s.s_store_id,
    s.s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to move date-related conditions closer to the `date_dim` table joins.
- **Join Reordering**: The joins are reordered to ensure that filtering happens as early as possible, especially after the `date_dim` conditions are checked.
- **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed from implicit joins to explicit joins for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Ensured only necessary columns are used in the joins and select.

These changes should help in reducing the execution time of the query by minimizing the amount of data being processed and by allowing the database engine to optimize the join order and data access paths more effectively.
