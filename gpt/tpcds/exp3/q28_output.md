To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, reduce the computational overhead, and potentially improve the execution plan generated by the PostgreSQL query planner. Here are the rules I will apply:

1. **Constant Folding**: Simplify arithmetic expressions that involve constants.
2. **Predicate Simplification**: Simplify the predicates where possible to make them more readable and potentially more efficient for the query planner.
3. **Elimination of Redundant Limits**: Since the query is selecting from subqueries and not ordering or joining them, a limit on the outer query that is high enough not to affect the result can be removed.

### Original Query Analysis:
The query consists of multiple subqueries each calculating average, count, and count distinct of `ss_list_price` for different ranges of `ss_quantity` and conditions on `ss_list_price`, `ss_coupon_amt`, and `ss_wholesale_cost`. Each subquery is independent of others and fetches data from the same table `store_sales` under different conditions.

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Constant Folding**:
   - Replace `107 + 10` with `117`, `1319 + 1000` with `2319`, `60 + 20` with `80`, and similarly for other subqueries.

2. **Predicate Simplification**:
   - This might not apply much here as the predicates are already quite straightforward after constant folding.

3. **Elimination of Redundant Limits**:
   - The `LIMIT 100` at the end of the query does not serve any purpose since each subquery is independent and not producing more than one row. The outer query simply combines these single rows from each subquery. Therefore, we can remove the `LIMIT` clause.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT
    B1.B1_LP,
    B1.B1_CNT,
    B1.B1_CNTD,
    B2.B2_LP,
    B2.B2_CNT,
    B2.B2_CNTD,
    B3.B3_LP,
    B3.B3_CNT,
    B3.B3_CNTD,
    B4.B4_LP,
    B4.B4_CNT,
    B4.B4_CNTD,
    B5.B5_LP,
    B5.B5_CNT,
    B5.B5_CNTD,
    B6.B6_LP,
    B6.B6_CNT,
    B6.B6_CNTD
FROM
    (SELECT AVG(ss_list_price) AS B1_LP, COUNT(ss_list_price) AS B1_CNT, COUNT(DISTINCT ss_list_price) AS B1_CNTD
     FROM store_sales
     WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 5
       AND (ss_list_price BETWEEN 107 AND 117
            OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 1319 AND 2319
            OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 60 AND 80)) B1,
    (SELECT AVG(ss_list_price) AS B2_LP, COUNT(ss_list_price) AS B2_CNT, COUNT(DISTINCT ss_list_price) AS B2_CNTD
     FROM store_sales
     WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 6 AND 10
       AND (ss_list_price BETWEEN 23 AND 33
            OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 825 AND 1825
            OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 43 AND 63)) B2,
    (SELECT AVG(ss_list_price) AS B3_LP, COUNT(ss_list_price) AS B3_CNT, COUNT(DISTINCT ss_list_price) AS B3_CNTD
     FROM store_sales
     WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 11 AND 15
       AND (ss_list_price BETWEEN 74 AND 84
            OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 4381 AND 5381
            OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 57 AND 77)) B3,
    (SELECT AVG(ss_list_price) AS B4_LP, COUNT(ss_list_price) AS B4_CNT, COUNT(DISTINCT ss_list_price) AS B4_CNTD
     FROM store_sales
     WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 16 AND 20
       AND (ss_list_price BETWEEN 89 AND 99
            OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 3117 AND 4117
            OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 68 AND 88)) B4,
    (SELECT AVG(ss_list_price) AS B5_LP, COUNT(ss_list_price) AS B5_CNT, COUNT(DISTINCT ss_list_price) AS B5_CNTD
     FROM store_sales
     WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 25
       AND (ss_list_price BETWEEN 58 AND 68
            OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 9402 AND 10402
            OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 38 AND 58)) B5,
    (SELECT AVG(ss_list_price) AS B6_LP, COUNT(ss_list_price) AS B6_CNT, COUNT(DISTINCT ss_list_price) AS B6_CNTD
     FROM store_sales
     WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 26 AND 30
       AND (ss_list_price BETWEEN 64 AND 74
            OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 5792 AND 6792
            OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 73 AND 93)) B6;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to the simplification of constant expressions and removal of unnecessary limit.
