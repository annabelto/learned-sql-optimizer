To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (filters) closer to the data source. It reduces the amount of data processed by filtering rows earlier in the execution plan.

2. **Join Reordering**: Adjusting the order of joins can significantly impact performance, especially in a query involving multiple joins. The goal is to reduce the size of intermediate results.

3. **Eliminating Redundant Columns**: Limiting the number of columns in the intermediate steps can reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed and transferred.

4. **Using Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This improves readability and can sometimes help the query optimizer understand the query better compared to implicit joins.

### Application of Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: The filter on `d_month_seq` is applied as early as possible to reduce the size of the data involved in subsequent joins and aggregations.

2. **Join Reordering**: Since the join conditions involve `d_date_dim` and `web_sales`, and then `item` and `web_sales`, we can reorder the joins to ensure that the potentially smaller dataset (`date_dim` filtered by `d_month_seq`) is used first to limit the size of the dataset for subsequent joins.

3. **Eliminating Redundant Columns**: In the subquery, only necessary columns for aggregation and final output are selected.

4. **Using Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    sub.total_sum,
    sub.i_category,
    sub.i_class,
    sub.lochierarchy,
    sub.rank_within_parent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ws.ws_net_paid) AS total_sum,
        i.i_category,
        i.i_class,
        GROUPING(i.i_category) + GROUPING(i.i_class) AS lochierarchy,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY GROUPING(i.i_category) + GROUPING(i.i_class), 
            CASE WHEN GROUPING(i.i_class) = 0 THEN i.i_category END 
            ORDER BY SUM(ws.ws_net_paid) DESC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        web_sales ws
        JOIN date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ws.ws_sold_date_sk
        JOIN item i ON i.i_item_sk = ws.ws_item_sk
    WHERE 
        d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1186 AND 1197
    GROUP BY 
        ROLLUP(i.i_category, i.i_class)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    sub.lochierarchy DESC, 
    CASE WHEN sub.lochierarchy = 0 THEN sub.i_category END, 
    sub.rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query applies the rules mentioned above to potentially improve execution performance by reducing the amount of data processed and clarifying the join conditions.
