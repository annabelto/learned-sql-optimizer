I apologize for the repeated errors in previous responses. Let's ensure the optimized query maintains the exact logic of the original query, including all conditions and joins, while applying optimization techniques correctly.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
    SELECT 
        wr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
        ca_state AS ctr_state,
        SUM(wr_return_amt) AS ctr_total_return
    FROM 
        web_returns
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON wr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        customer_address ON wr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2000
    GROUP BY 
        wr_returning_customer_sk, ca_state
)
SELECT 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    c_preferred_cust_flag,
    c_birth_day,
    c_birth_month,
    c_birth_year,
    c_birth_country,
    c_login,
    c_email_address,
    c_last_review_date_sk AS c_last_review_date,
    ctr_total_return
FROM 
    customer_total_return ctr1
JOIN 
    customer ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    ca_state = 'AR' AND
    ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
        SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
        FROM customer_total_return ctr2
        WHERE ctr1.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state
    )
ORDER BY 
    c_customer_id, c_salutation, c_first_name, c_last_name, c_preferred_cust_flag, 
    c_birth_day, c_birth_month, c_birth_year, c_birth_country, c_login, c_email_address, 
    c_last_review_date, ctr_total_return
LIMIT 100;
```

This version of the query should now correctly reflect the original logic, including the correct handling of joins and subqueries. The optimization focuses on ensuring the joins and subqueries are correctly structured to maintain the integrity of the original query's output while potentially improving performance through better structuring and clarity in the SQL commands.
