To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule involves moving the filter conditions into the subqueries (CTEs) to reduce the size of the data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query. By applying filters earlier, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be joined, which can significantly improve performance.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Group By**: Since the grouping columns are the same as the join condition in the final query, and since we are only counting distinct combinations, we can eliminate the `GROUP BY` in the CTEs and use `DISTINCT` instead. This can simplify the execution plan and potentially reduce the computational overhead.

3. **Use of Proper Joins**: Changing the `FULL OUTER JOIN` to `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` separately can sometimes help in execution, especially if the database can optimize these joins differently based on the data distribution and indexes.

Here's the rewritten query applying these rules:

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH ssci AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT ss_customer_sk AS customer_sk, ss_item_sk AS item_sk
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1199 AND 1210
), 
csci AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT cs_bill_customer_sk AS customer_sk, cs_item_sk AS item_sk
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1199 AND 1210
)
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN ssci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS store_only,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ssci.customer_sk IS NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS catalog_only,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ssci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS store_and_catalog
FROM ssci
FULL OUTER JOIN csci ON ssci.customer_sk = csci.customer_sk AND ssci.item_sk = csci.item_sk
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Filters on `d_month_seq` are moved into the CTEs.
- **Eliminate Redundant Group By**: Replaced `GROUP BY` with `DISTINCT` in the CTEs.
- **Use of Proper Joins**: Maintained the `FULL OUTER JOIN` as it is necessary to capture all combinations of `store_only`, `catalog_only`, and `store_and_catalog`. However, depending on the data distribution and indexes, considering separate `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` might be beneficial but would require additional logic to combine results, which might not be straightforward.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data movement and earlier application of filters.
