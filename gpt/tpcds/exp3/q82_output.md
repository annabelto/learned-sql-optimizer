Apologies for the oversight. Let's re-evaluate the optimization while ensuring that the output of the optimized query matches that of the original query. We will maintain the necessary GROUP BY clause and ensure all conditions and joins are correctly optimized.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
FROM item, inventory, date_dim, store_sales 
WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 58 AND 58 + 30 
  AND inv_item_sk = i_item_sk 
  AND d_date_sk = inv_date_sk 
  AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2001-01-13' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2001-01-13' AS DATE) + 60) 
  AND i_manufact_id IN (259, 559, 580, 485) 
  AND inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500 
  AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
ORDER BY i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
FROM item
JOIN inventory ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk AND inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk AND d_date BETWEEN '2001-01-13'::date AND '2001-03-14'::date
JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 58 AND 88
  AND i_manufact_id IN (259, 559, 580, 485)
GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
ORDER BY i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit JOINs for clarity and better join control.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved conditions related to specific tables directly into the JOIN conditions where applicable. This includes moving conditions on `inv_quantity_on_hand` and `d_date` into the respective JOIN clauses.
- **Simplified Date Expressions**: Simplified the date range calculations for better readability and potentially better performance.
- **Maintained GROUP BY**: Kept the GROUP BY clause as it is necessary for ensuring the correct grouping and aggregation of results.
- **Limit Pushdown**: The LIMIT clause is already optimally placed at the end of the query.

These changes should help in improving the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data shuffled between operations and making the execution plan more efficient, while ensuring that the output remains consistent with the original query.
