To optimize the given PostgreSQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates (conditions) as close as possible to where the data originates, which can reduce the amount of data scanned and processed.
2. **Join Reordering**: Change the order of joins to start with the smallest tables or those with the most restrictive filters, which can reduce the intermediate result sizes.
3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated tables) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control over join behavior.
4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Remove unnecessary columns from the SELECT and JOIN clauses that are not used elsewhere in the query.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category, AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM inventory, date_dim, item
WHERE inv_date_sk = d_date_sk AND inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211
GROUP BY ROLLUP(i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category)
ORDER BY qoh, i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**:
   Convert the implicit joins to explicit joins for clarity and better join control.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   Push the condition `d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211` closer to the `date_dim` table to potentially reduce the number of rows joined from `date_dim`.

3. **Join Reordering**:
   Assuming `date_dim` is smaller or has more restrictive filters after applying predicate pushdown, start the joins with `date_dim`.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category, AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM date_dim
JOIN inventory ON inv_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN item ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211
GROUP BY ROLLUP(i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category)
ORDER BY qoh, i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

In this optimized query:
- The explicit JOIN syntax clarifies the relationships between tables.
- The predicate pushdown reduces the number of rows processed in the early stages of the query.
- Join reordering starts with `date_dim`, which is filtered by `d_month_seq`, potentially reducing the size of the dataset early in the execution plan.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage of the query.
