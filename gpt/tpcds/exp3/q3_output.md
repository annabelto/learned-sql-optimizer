To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter conditions as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data scanned and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Join Reordering**: Adjusting the order of joins can significantly impact performance, especially in a query involving multiple joins. The goal is to reduce the size of intermediate results.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax (e.g., INNER JOIN) for better readability and control over join execution.

4. **Column Pruning**: Only select the columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in joins and conditions, to reduce the amount of data processed.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the conditions `item.i_manufact_id = 816` and `dt.d_moy=11` closer to the respective table scans.
   
2. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert the query to use explicit JOINs which are easier to read and optimize by the query planner.

3. **Join Reordering**: Although the optimal join order might depend on the specific data distribution and table sizes, a common heuristic is to perform selective filters early and reduce the size of join operands by joining smaller tables or the results of filtered tables first.

4. **Column Pruning**: Ensure only necessary columns are selected in the intermediate steps.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    item.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    store_sales ss ON item.i_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim dt ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = dt.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    item.i_manufact_id = 816
    AND dt.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_brand,
    item.i_brand_id
ORDER BY 
    dt.d_year,
    sum_agg DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `item.i_manufact_id` and `dt.d_moy` are applied directly in the WHERE clause, reducing the number of rows joined from `item` and `date_dim`.

- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query now uses explicit INNER JOINs, which are clearer and typically preferred for expressing joins.

- **Join Reordering**: The query starts with the `item` table, which is filtered by `i_manufact_id`, likely reducing the number of rows early. It then joins `store_sales`, followed by `date_dim`, which is also filtered by `d_moy`.

- **Column Pruning**: The SELECT and JOIN clauses only include necessary columns for the final output or for conditions, minimizing the data processed through the query execution plan.

This rewritten query should perform better due to reduced I/O and more efficient use of indexes and joins.
