To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data processed by filtering rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Simplify expressions and remove duplicates to reduce the complexity of the query.

3. **Use of IN instead of multiple ORs**: Simplify the conditions to make the query more readable and potentially improve optimizer efficiency.

4. **Remove Duplicate Values in IN Clauses**: Ensure that values in IN clauses are not repeated to avoid unnecessary processing.

5. **Join Condition Optimization**: Rearrange joins to ensure that smaller result sets are produced early, which can then be used to filter subsequent larger tables.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    ca_city,
    bought_city,
    ss_ticket_number,
    amt,
    profit
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        ca_city AS bought_city,
        SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
        JOIN household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON store_sales.ss_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 8 OR household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count = 0)
        AND date_dim.d_dow IN (6, 0)
        AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
        AND store.s_city IN ('Midway', 'Fairview')
    GROUP BY 
        ss_ticket_number, 
        ss_customer_sk, 
        ss_addr_sk, 
        ca_city
) dn
JOIN customer ON dn.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address current_addr ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = current_addr.ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    current_addr.ca_city <> bought_city
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    ca_city,
    bought_city,
    ss_ticket_number
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved conditions related to `household_demographics`, `date_dim`, and `store` directly into the subquery where the tables are joined, which helps in reducing the dataset early.
- **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Removed duplicate values in the `store.s_city IN` clause.
- **Use of IN instead of multiple ORs**: Converted the `date_dim.d_year` condition to use `IN` for clarity and potential performance benefit.
- **Join Condition Optimization**: Explicitly used JOINs instead of listing all tables in the FROM clause, which helps in understanding the join conditions and potentially allows the optimizer to better plan the joins.

These optimizations aim to make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and clarifying the join conditions and filters.
