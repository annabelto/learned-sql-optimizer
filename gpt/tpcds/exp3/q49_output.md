I apologize for the previous attempts. Let's ensure that the optimized query maintains the exact logical structure and output as the original query, while applying optimization techniques correctly.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank
FROM (
    SELECT 'web' AS channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank
    FROM (
        SELECT ws_item_sk AS item,
               CAST(SUM(COALESCE(wr_return_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(SUM(ws_quantity) AS DECIMAL(15,4)) AS return_ratio,
               rank() OVER (ORDER BY CAST(SUM(COALESCE(wr_return_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(SUM(ws_quantity) AS DECIMAL(15,4))) AS return_rank,
               rank() OVER (ORDER BY CAST(SUM(COALESCE(wr_return_amt, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(SUM(ws_net_paid) AS DECIMAL(15,4))) AS currency_rank
        FROM web_sales ws
        LEFT JOIN web_returns wr ON ws.ws_order_number = wr.wr_order_number AND ws.ws_item_sk = wr.wr_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
        WHERE wr_return_amt > 10000 AND ws_net_profit > 1 AND ws_net_paid > 0 AND ws_quantity > 0
          AND d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 11
        GROUP BY ws_item_sk
    ) web
    WHERE return_rank <= 10 OR currency_rank <= 10

    UNION ALL

               CAST(SUM(COALESCE(cr_return_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(SUM(cs_quantity) AS DECIMAL(15,4)) AS return_ratio,
               rank() OVER (ORDER BY CAST(SUM(COALESCE(cr_return_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(SUM(cs_quantity) AS DECIMAL(15,4))) AS return_rank,

          AND d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 11
        GROUP BY cs_item_sk
    ) catalog
    WHERE return_rank <= 10 OR currency_rank <= 10

    UNION ALL

    SELECT 'store' AS channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank
    FROM (
        SELECT ss_item_sk AS item,
               CAST(SUM(COALESCE(sr_return_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(SUM(ss_quantity) AS DECIMAL(15,4)) AS return_ratio,

        WHERE sr_return_amt > 10000 AND ss_net_profit > 1 AND ss_net_paid > 0 AND ss_quantity > 0
          AND d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 11
        GROUP BY ss_item_sk
    ) store
    WHERE return_rank <= 10 OR currency_rank <= 10
) AS final_results
ORDER BY channel, return_rank, currency_rank, item
LIMIT 100;
```

This version of the query:
- Correctly aliases all subqueries.
- Uses `UNION ALL` to combine results from different channels, assuming that each channel's data is distinct.
- Maintains the same filtering and grouping logic as the original query.
- Keeps the ordering and limiting of results consistent with the original query.
