Apologies for the confusion. The "### Optimized Query" was intended as a markdown heading for clarity in the response, not as part of the SQL query. Here is the corrected optimized query without the markdown syntax:

```sql
WITH date_filter AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_week_seq IN (
        SELECT d_week_seq
        FROM date_dim
        WHERE d_date IN ('2001-07-13', '2001-09-10', '2001-11-16')
    )
),
sr_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(sr_return_quantity) AS sr_item_qty
    FROM store_returns
    JOIN item ON sr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_filter ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
cr_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(cr_return_quantity) AS cr_item_qty
    FROM catalog_returns
    JOIN item ON cr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_filter ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
wr_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(wr_return_quantity) AS wr_item_qty
    FROM web_returns
    JOIN item ON wr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_filter ON wr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT
    sr_items.item_id,
    sr_item_qty,
    sr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS sr_dev,
    cr_item_qty,
    cr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS cr_dev,
    wr_item_qty,
    wr_item_qty / (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 * 100 AS wr_dev,
    (sr_item_qty + cr_item_qty + wr_item_qty) / 3.0 AS average
FROM sr_items
JOIN cr_items ON sr_items.item_id = cr_items.item_id
JOIN wr_items ON sr_items.item_id = wr_items.item_id
ORDER BY sr_items.item_id, sr_item_qty
LIMIT 100;
```

This query should execute without syntax errors and provides an optimized version of the original query using the strategies described previously.
