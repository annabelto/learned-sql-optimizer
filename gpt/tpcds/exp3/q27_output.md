To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data scanned and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Simplify or remove redundant expressions or conditions to streamline the execution.

3. **Simplifying IN Clause**: The `IN` clause in the query contains multiple identical values, which can be simplified to a single value.

4. **Use of Proper Joins**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in the `FROM` clause) with explicit `JOIN` syntax for better readability and potentially more efficient execution plans.

5. **Column Pruning**: Ensure only necessary columns are fetched in the select and join clauses.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    s_state, 
    grouping(s_state) AS g_state, 
    avg(ss_quantity) AS agg1, 
    avg(ss_list_price) AS agg2, 
    avg(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, 
    avg(ss_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    cd_gender = 'M' 
    AND cd_marital_status = 'W' 
    AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary' 
    AND d_year = 1999 
    AND s_state = 'TN' -- Simplified IN clause
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP (i_item_id, s_state)
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id, s_state
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Predicate Pushdown**: All filters related to `customer_demographics` and `date_dim` are applied directly in the `WHERE` clause.
- **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Removed redundant values in the `IN` clause for `s_state`.
- **Use of Proper Joins**: Converted the query to use explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and potential performance benefits.
- **Column Pruning**: Ensured that only the necessary columns are being used in the joins and selects.

These changes should help in optimizing the query execution by reducing the amount of data being processed and clarifying the query structure for the database engine.
