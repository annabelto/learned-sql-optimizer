To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates (conditions in the WHERE clause) as close as possible to the data sources. This reduces the number of rows processed in the joins by filtering out rows as early as possible.

2. **Eliminate Unnecessary Order By**: Since the query uses an aggregate function (`count(*)`) without a GROUP BY clause, the ORDER BY clause is redundant because there is only one row being returned. Removing this will save sorting overhead.

3. **Limit Pushdown**: If there's a limit in the query, ensuring that this limit is considered early in the execution can reduce the amount of data processed.

4. **Join Reordering**: Based on the selectivity of the filters and the size of the tables, reorder the joins to start with the most restrictive joins or smallest resultant datasets.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM 
    store
    JOIN store_sales ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
    JOIN time_dim ON ss_sold_time_sk = t_time_sk
WHERE
    time_dim.t_hour = 8
    AND time_dim.t_minute >= 30
    AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 0
    AND store.s_store_name = 'ese'
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: I've moved all conditions directly related to each table into the JOIN conditions or directly after the JOINs in the WHERE clause. This ensures that each table is filtered as early as possible.

2. **Eliminate Unnecessary Order By**: I removed the `ORDER BY count(*)` clause because it is unnecessary when we are only retrieving a count with no GROUP BY.

3. **Limit Pushdown**: The `LIMIT 100` is maintained at the end of the query. However, since the query results in a single count value, the limit doesn't affect performance but is kept as per the original query structure.

4. **Join Reordering**: The order of joins might be adjusted based on the known data distributions and indexes. However, without specific database statistics, a general heuristic is used based on the filtering conditions provided. Typically, starting with `store` might be beneficial due to the direct equality condition on `s_store_name`.

These optimizations aim to reduce the amount of data being processed and the complexity of operations such as sorting and aggregation by leveraging SQL execution planning strategies effectively.
