I apologize for the confusion in previous responses. Let's address the issue correctly this time by ensuring that the window functions and their results are properly defined and accessible in the query.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH web_v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        ws_item_sk AS item_sk, 
        d_date, 
        SUM(ws_sales_price) AS daily_sales,
        SUM(SUM(ws_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY ws_item_sk ORDER BY d_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cume_sales
    FROM 
        web_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1212 AND 1223
        AND ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        ws_item_sk, d_date
), 
store_v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        ss_item_sk AS item_sk, 
        d_date, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS daily_sales,
        SUM(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY ss_item_sk ORDER BY d_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cume_sales
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1212 AND 1223
        AND ss_item_sk IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        ss_item_sk, d_date
)
SELECT 
    item_sk,
    d_date,
    web_sales,
    store_sales,
    web_cumulative,
    store_cumulative
FROM (
    SELECT 
        COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) AS item_sk,
        COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) AS d_date,
        web.cume_sales AS web_sales,
        store.cume_sales AS store_sales,
        MAX(web.cume_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) ORDER BY COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date)) AS web_cumulative,
        MAX(store.cume_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) ORDER BY COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date)) AS store_cumulative
    FROM 
        web_v1 web
    FULL OUTER JOIN 
        store_v1 store ON web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date
) x
WHERE 
    web_cumulative > store_cumulative
ORDER BY 
    item_sk, d_date
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Window Functions for Cumulative Sales**: The cumulative sales are calculated within the CTEs using a window function that sums up the daily sales.
- **Correct Use of Window Functions in Subquery**: The `web_cumulative` and `store_cumulative` are calculated in the subquery using the `MAX` window function over the cumulative sales. This ensures that these columns are defined before they are used in the `WHERE` clause.
- **COALESCE in Window Functions**: The `COALESCE` function is used in the partitioning of the window functions to handle any potential NULL values from the full outer join, ensuring correct grouping and ordering.

This query should now execute correctly and provide the intended results, maintaining the logic of the original query while ensuring syntactical correctness and optimization.
