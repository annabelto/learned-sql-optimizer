To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subqueries (CTEs) to reduce the size of the data that needs to be processed in the main query.
2. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries.
3. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if the join keys and filters guarantee identical results.
4. **Simplification of Expressions**: Simplify complex expressions where possible, especially in the SELECT and WHERE clauses.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query uses two common table expressions (CTEs), `ss` and `ws`, to aggregate sales data from `store_sales` and `web_sales` respectively. It then performs a complex selection to compare sales growth across different quarters of the same year.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown
We can push the conditions related to `d_qoy` and `d_year` into the CTEs to reduce the amount of data processed in the main query.

#### 2. Common Subexpression Elimination
The conditions for year and county are repeated across multiple joins and can be simplified by ensuring these filters are applied once in the CTEs.

#### 3. Join Elimination
Given the structure of the query, join elimination isn't directly applicable as all joins are necessary for the final result. However, ensuring that the joins are as efficient as possible by using appropriate keys is crucial.

#### 4. Simplification of Expressions
The CASE statements in the WHERE clause can be simplified by pre-computing these ratios in the CTEs if they are used multiple times.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH ss AS (
    SELECT 
        ca_county,
        d_qoy,
        d_year,
        SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS store_sales
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 1999 AND d_qoy IN (1, 2, 3)
    GROUP BY 
        ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
), 
ws AS (
    SELECT 
        ca_county,
        d_qoy,
        d_year,
        SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS web_sales
    FROM 
        web_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 1999 AND d_qoy IN (1, 2, 3)
    GROUP BY 
        ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
)
SELECT 
    ss1.ca_county,
    ss1.d_year,
    ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales AS web_q1_q2_increase,
    ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales AS store_q1_q2_increase,
    ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales AS web_q2_q3_increase,
    ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales AS store_q2_q3_increase
FROM 
    ss ss1
    JOIN ss ss2 ON ss1.ca_county = ss2.ca_county AND ss1.d_year = ss2.d_year
    JOIN ss ss3 ON ss2.ca_county = ss3.ca_county AND ss2.d_year = ss3.d_year
    JOIN ws ws1 ON ss1.ca_county = ws1.ca_county AND ss1.d_year = ws1.d_year
    JOIN ws ws2 ON ws1.ca_county = ws2.ca_county AND ws1.d_year = ws2.d_year
    JOIN ws ws3 ON ws2.ca_county = ws3.ca_county AND ws2.d_year = ws3.d_year
WHERE 
    ss1.d_qoy = 1 AND ss2.d_qoy = 2 AND ss3.d_qoy = 3 AND
    ws1.d_qoy = 1 AND ws2.d_qoy = 2 AND ws3.d_qoy = 3 AND
    ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales > ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales AND
    ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales > ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales
ORDER BY 
    store_q2_q3_increase;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data processing and simplified conditions.
