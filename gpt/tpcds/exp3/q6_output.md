To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the semantics of the query. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the number of rows processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Subquery Flattening**: Convert correlated subqueries to joins where possible, which can be more efficiently executed by the query planner.

3. **Use of Temporary Aggregations**: Pre-aggregate data in subqueries to reduce the size of data that needs to be joined.

4. **Elimination of Distinct**: When used inside a subquery that is only checking existence or in aggregation, `distinct` can often be removed if the query logic allows.

5. **Index Suggestions**: Although not directly a rewrite, suggesting the use of indexes on filtered columns can significantly improve performance.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the conditions on `date_dim` and `item` closer to their respective table scans.
   
2. **Subquery Flattening**: The subquery for `d_month_seq` can be joined with the `date_dim` table. The subquery calculating `avg(i_current_price)` can be precomputed and joined.

3. **Elimination of Distinct**: In the subquery selecting `d_month_seq`, `distinct` is not necessary if the query guarantees uniqueness through other constraints or data characteristics.

4. **Temporary Aggregations**: Precompute the average current price for each category in `item` and use this in the main query.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
WITH avg_price AS (
    SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) AS avg_price
    FROM item
    GROUP BY i_category
),
month_seq AS (
    SELECT d_month_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM customer_address a
JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
JOIN store_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
JOIN date_dim d ON s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN avg_price ap ON i.i_category = ap.i_category
JOIN month_seq ms ON d.d_month_seq = ms.d_month_seq
WHERE i.i_current_price > 1.2 * ap.avg_price
GROUP BY a.ca_state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:

- **CTEs (`avg_price` and `month_seq`)**: These common table expressions precompute the average price per category and the month sequence for March 2002, reducing the complexity within the main query.
- **Joins instead of Subqueries**: The query uses joins to integrate the precomputed average prices and month sequence, which is generally more efficient than correlated subqueries.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Filters are applied directly in the joins and CTEs, reducing the amount of data processed in the main query.
- **Order of Execution**: The query first computes necessary averages and sequences, then performs the main selection and aggregation, which is efficient in terms of data handling and computation.
