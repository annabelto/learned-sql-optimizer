To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: Adjusting the order of joins can significantly impact performance, especially in a query involving multiple joins. The goal is to reduce the size of intermediate results.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (in the WHERE clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it allows the optimizer to better understand the join conditions.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Removing unnecessary columns from SELECT and GROUP BY clauses if they are not needed in the output or subsequent processing.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions related to `date_dim`, `item`, `customer`, and `store` directly into the respective ON clauses in JOINs.
2. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert the implicit joins to explicit JOINs.
3. **Join Reordering**: Since filtering on `item` and `date_dim` reduces the dataset size quickly due to specific conditions (`i_manager_id=14`, `d_moy=11`, `d_year=2002`), join these tables early.
4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Ensure only necessary columns are included in the SELECT and GROUP BY clauses.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
    i.i_brand AS brand, 
    i.i_manufact_id, 
    i.i_manufact, 
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM 
    item i
JOIN 
    store_sales ss ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    customer c ON ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    store s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_manager_id = 14 AND
    d.d_moy = 11 AND
    d.d_year = 2002 AND
    SUBSTR(ca.ca_zip, 1, 5) <> SUBSTR(s.s_zip, 1, 5)
GROUP BY 
    i.i_brand, 
    i.i_brand_id, 
    i.i_manufact_id, 
    i.i_manufact
ORDER BY 
    ext_price DESC, 
    i.i_brand, 
    i.i_brand_id, 
    i.i_manufact_id, 
    i.i_manufact
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query uses explicit JOIN syntax, applies predicate pushdown, and reorders joins to potentially improve execution efficiency. The query is now more readable and better structured for performance optimization by the database engine.
