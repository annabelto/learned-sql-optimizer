To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates into subqueries to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution plan.
2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not contribute to the final result.
3. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify or pre-calculate expressions to reduce complexity during query execution.
4. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Convert implicit joins to explicit joins for better readability and potentially more efficient execution plans.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple tables (`customer`, `customer_address`, `customer_demographics`, `store_sales`, `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `date_dim`) and has conditions on `d_year` and `d_moy` in subqueries. It also uses `EXISTS` to check for related sales records.

### Applying Optimization Rules

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
Push predicates related to `d_year` and `d_moy` directly into the subqueries to reduce the number of rows processed in the subqueries.

#### Step 2: Simplifying Expressions
The expression `3+3` in the date range can be simplified to `6`.

#### Step 3: Use of Explicit Joins
Convert implicit joins to explicit joins using `JOIN` keyword for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data scanning and clearer join conditions.
