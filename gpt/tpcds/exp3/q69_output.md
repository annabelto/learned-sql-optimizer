Apologies for the oversight. Let's revisit the optimization while ensuring that the output of the query remains consistent with the original. We'll focus on maintaining the logical integrity of the query while applying optimization techniques that do not alter the results.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    COUNT(*) AS cnt1, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    COUNT(*) AS cnt2, 
    cd_credit_rating,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt3
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd ON cd.cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk
WHERE 
    ca.ca_state IN ('IL', 'TX', 'ME')
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM 
            store_sales ss
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = ss.ss_customer_sk
            AND d.d_year = 2002
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM 
            web_sales ws
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = ws.ws_bill_customer_sk
            AND d.d_year = 2002
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM 
            catalog_sales cs
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = cs.cs_ship_customer_sk
            AND d.d_year = 2002
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )
GROUP BY 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd_credit_rating
ORDER BY 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_education_status, 
    cd_purchase_estimate, 
    cd_credit_rating
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Use of Explicit Joins**: Changed implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and better join control.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved conditions related to `date_dim` into the `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries to filter rows as early as possible.
- **Subquery Flattening**: Although the subqueries are necessary for existence checks, they have been simplified to return `1` instead of `*` to minimize data transfer.

These changes aim to improve the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data shuffled and processed, and by making better use of indexes and join operations. The logical structure and output of the query remain unchanged from the original.
