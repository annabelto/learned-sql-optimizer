To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be loaded and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result set (i.e., it does not filter or add columns to the output), it can be eliminated.

3. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: If subqueries are repeated with the same expressions, they can be computed once and reused.

4. **Simplifying Joins**: Convert implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and potentially more efficient execution plans.

        )
        OR EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM 
                catalog_sales cs
            JOIN

                AND d.d_qoy < 4
        )
    )
GROUP BY 
    ca_state, 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_dep_count, 
    cd_dep_employed_count, 
    cd_dep_college_count

    ca_state, 
    cd_gender,

LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the year and quarter conditions into the subquery joins with `date_dim`.
- **Simplifying Joins**: Changed implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and potential performance improvement.
- **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Not directly applied here as the subqueries are necessary for the EXISTS conditions, but ensured minimal repetition by using simple EXISTS conditions.
- **Join Elimination**: Not applicable as all joins contribute to the result set.

This rewritten query should be more efficient due to the clearer structure and early filtering of data.
