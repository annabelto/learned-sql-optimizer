Apologies for the oversight. Let's revisit the optimization while ensuring that the output of the optimized query matches the original query. We'll focus on maintaining the logical equivalence while applying optimizations.

### Revising the Optimization Strategy:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This is still valid and should be applied where possible without changing the join structure that might affect the result set.

2. **Join Reordering**: We need to be cautious with join reordering to not affect the result set. We'll analyze the selectivity and relationships but maintain the original join paths.

3. **Use of IN instead of OR for List Checks**: This was correctly used in the original query.

4. **Eliminating Redundant Columns**: We'll ensure that only necessary columns are fetched, but without altering the join conditions that depend on these columns.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE (substr(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
       OR ca_state IN ('CA', 'WA', 'GA')
       OR cs_sales_price > 500)
  AND d_qoy = 2
  AND d_year = 2001
GROUP BY ca_zip
ORDER BY ca_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions related to `date_dim` (`d_qoy = 2 AND d_year = 2001`) and `cs_sales_price > 500` are already close to their respective tables in the `WHERE` clause, which is optimal for reducing the size of joined data.
- **Join Reordering**: The original join order is maintained because altering it could potentially change the semantics due to how SQL handles `OUTER JOINs` and filtering conditions in `WHERE` clauses. The original query does not specify join types, so they are treated as inner joins, which are commutative and associative. However, reordering could still lead to different execution plans, so without specific database statistics, it's safer to maintain the order.
- **Eliminating Redundant Columns**: The query only selects and groups by `ca_zip` and sums `cs_sales_price`, so only these columns need to be processed in the final projection, which is already handled in the query.

This revised query maintains the logical structure of the original while ensuring that optimizations do not alter the expected results.
