To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates closer to the data source, reducing the number of rows processed in the upper layers of the query.
2. **Join Simplification**: Simplify the join conditions and ensure that they are as efficient as possible.
3. **Eliminate Redundant Columns**: Remove unnecessary columns from the SELECT and JOIN clauses that are not used elsewhere in the query.
4. **Use Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert implicit joins in the FROM clause to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

### Original Query
```sql
select ss_customer_sk, sum(act_sales) as sumsales
from (
    select ss_item_sk, ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk,
           case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity) * ss_sales_price
                else ss_quantity * ss_sales_price
           end as act_sales
    from store_sales
    left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number),
    reason
    where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk and r_reason_desc = 'reason 58'
) t
group by ss_customer_sk
order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
limit 100;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the condition `r_reason_desc = 'reason 58'` closer to the table `reason` in the subquery.
2. **Use Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert the implicit join with the `reason` table to an explicit `INNER JOIN`.
3. **Eliminate Redundant Columns**: Remove `ss_item_sk` and `ss_ticket_number` from the inner select as they are not used in the final output.

### Optimized Query
```sql
select ss_customer_sk, sum(act_sales) as sumsales
from (
    select ss_customer_sk,
           case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity) * ss_sales_price
                else ss_quantity * ss_sales_price
           end as act_sales
    from store_sales
    left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
    inner join reason on sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
    where r_reason_desc = 'reason 58'
) t
group by ss_customer_sk
order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
limit 100;
```

In this optimized version:
- The `INNER JOIN` with the `reason` table is now explicit, which helps clarify the join conditions and may help the database optimize the join.
- The predicate `r_reason_desc = 'reason 58'` is applied directly in the subquery where `reason` is joined, which reduces the number of rows processed early in the query execution.
- Unnecessary columns (`ss_item_sk`, `ss_ticket_number`) are removed from the inner select, reducing the data that needs to be processed and passed around.
