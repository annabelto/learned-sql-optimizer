To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the complexity and improving the performance of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates as close as possible to the data source. By applying filters early, we reduce the number of rows and hence the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a table in a join operation does not contribute to the final result (other than through the join condition), it can be eliminated.

3. **Simplifying OR Conditions**: Consolidate and simplify conditions to reduce the complexity of the query, which can help the query planner optimize the execution plan.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple joins and complex OR conditions. The query filters on multiple attributes from different tables and checks for specific conditions.

### Applying Predicate Pushdown
We push predicates related to specific tables directly into the join condition or immediately after the join, which can help in filtering out unnecessary data early in the query execution.

### Applying Join Elimination
In this query, all tables seem to contribute to the result either through join conditions or filter conditions, so join elimination does not apply directly here.

### Simplifying OR Conditions
We can simplify the OR conditions by grouping similar conditions together and reducing redundancy.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(ss_quantity)
FROM store_sales
JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001
JOIN customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = ss_cdemo_sk
JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk AND ca_country = 'United States'
WHERE 
    (
        (cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 100.00 AND 150.00) OR
        (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00) OR
        (cd_marital_status = 'D' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 150.00 AND 200.00)
    ) AND
    (
        (ca_state IN ('ND', 'NY', 'SD') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 0 AND 2000) OR
        (ca_state IN ('MD', 'GA', 'KS') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 150 AND 3000) OR
        (ca_state IN ('CO', 'MN', 'NC') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 50 AND 25000)
    );
```

### Explanation
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to move conditions related to `date_dim`, `customer_demographics`, and `customer_address` closer to their respective table joins.
- **Simplifying OR Conditions**: Conditions within the `customer_demographics` and `customer_address` filters are grouped to reduce complexity and potentially aid the optimizer in creating a more efficient execution plan.

This rewritten query should be more efficient due to early filtering and reduced complexity in conditional logic.
