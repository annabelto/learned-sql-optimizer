To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subqueries (CTEs) where possible. This reduces the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries to avoid repeated work.

3. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify or reorganize expressions for clarity and potential performance improvement.

4. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_brand, 
        cc_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_moy, 
        SUM(cs_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(cs_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year) AS avg_monthly_sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, cc_name ORDER BY d_year, d_moy) AS rn
    FROM 
        item
    JOIN 
        catalog_sales ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN 
        call_center ON cc_call_center_sk = cs_call_center_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001 OR 
        (d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 12) OR 
        (d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 1)
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, d_moy
), 
v2 AS (
    SELECT 
        v1.i_category, 
        v1.i_brand, 
        v1.cc_name,
        v1.d_year,
        v1.avg_monthly_sales,
        v1.sum_sales,
        v1_lag.sum_sales AS psum,
        v1_lead.sum_sales AS nsum
    FROM 
        v1
    JOIN 
        v1 AS v1_lag ON v1.i_category = v1_lag.i_category AND v1.i_brand = v1_lag.i_brand AND v1.cc_name = v1_lag.cc_name AND v1.rn = v1_lag.rn + 1
    JOIN 
        v1 AS v1_lead ON v1.i_category = v1_lead.i_category AND v1.i_brand = v1_lead.i_brand AND v1.cc_name = v1_lead.cc_name AND v1.rn = v1_lead.rn - 1
    WHERE 
        v1.d_year = 2001
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    v2
WHERE 
    avg_monthly_sales > 0 AND 
    ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    avg_monthly_sales
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: The condition `v1.d_year = 2001` is moved into the definition of `v2` to reduce the amount of data processed in the join and subsequent filtering.
- **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Not explicitly shown here, but ensuring that expressions like `d_year = 2001 - 1` are calculated once.
- **Simplifying Expressions**: The date conditions are simplified for clarity.
- **Join Elimination**: Not applicable here as all joins contribute to the final result.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage of the query by minimizing the amount of data being processed and transferred across different stages of the query execution.
