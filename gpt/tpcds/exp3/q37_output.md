To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include predicate pushdown, join elimination, and using explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potential optimization by the query planner. Hereâ€™s how these rules can be applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source in the query. By applying filters early, especially on tables with potentially large datasets, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can help in understanding the query better and can also assist the database's query planner in optimizing the joins more effectively.

3. **Join Elimination**: If after applying other optimizations, certain joins do not affect the result, they can be eliminated. However, in this query, all joins seem necessary based on the provided conditions and selected columns.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_current_price
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    inventory ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE 
    i_current_price BETWEEN 29 AND 59
    AND d_date BETWEEN '2002-03-29'::date AND ('2002-03-29'::date + INTERVAL '60 days')
    AND i_manufact_id IN (705, 742, 777, 944)
    AND inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit INNER JOINs for better readability and optimization.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions related to each table are placed directly in the JOIN conditions or in the WHERE clause immediately after the relevant table is mentioned. This helps in filtering data at the earliest possible stage.
- **Simplified Date and Arithmetic Expressions**: The date arithmetic and the BETWEEN conditions are simplified for clarity and potentially better performance.

These changes should help in optimizing the execution of the query by reducing the amount of data being processed and making the query plan more efficient.
