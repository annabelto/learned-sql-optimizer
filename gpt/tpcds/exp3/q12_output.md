To optimize the given PostgreSQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated.
3. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control.
4. **Simplification of Expressions**: Simplify or precompute expressions where possible.

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ws_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    web_sales,
    item,
    date_dim
WHERE 
    ws_item_sk = i_item_sk AND
    i_category IN ('Men', 'Books', 'Electronics') AND
    ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND
    d_date BETWEEN CAST('2001-06-15' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2001-06-15' AS DATE) + 30)
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the category filter closer to the `item` table and the date filter closer to the `date_dim` table.
2. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Convert implicit joins to explicit joins for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
3. **Simplification of Expressions**: Precompute the date range once.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ws_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    web_sales
JOIN 
    item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_category IN ('Men', 'Books', 'Electronics') AND
    d_date BETWEEN DATE '2001-06-15' AND DATE '2001-06-15' + INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

In this optimized query:
- The `JOIN` syntax is used explicitly to clarify the relationships between tables.
- The date range is simplified using the `DATE` type and `INTERVAL`.
- Filters are pushed down to operate as close to the table scans as possible, reducing the amount of data flowing through the joins and group by operations.
