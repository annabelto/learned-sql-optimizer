To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subquery where possible. This reduces the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant calculations or subqueries to avoid repeated work.

3. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify or reorganize expressions for clarity and potential performance improvement.

4. **Use of Window Functions Efficiently**: Adjust the use of window functions to minimize the overhead.

### Optimized Query

    SELECT

                            AND v1.s_company_name = v1_lag.s_company_name
                            AND v1.rn = v1_lag.rn + 1
        JOIN v1 AS v1_lead ON v1.i_category = v1_lead.i_category
                            AND v1.i_brand = v1_lead.i_brand

                            AND v1.rn = v1_lead.rn - 1
    WHERE 
        v1.d_year = 2000 AND 
        v1.avg_monthly_sales > 0
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    v2
WHERE 
    ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    nsum
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The `WHERE` clause conditions related to `d_year` and `d_moy` are moved into the subquery `v1` to reduce the data processed in the join operations.
- **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Not explicitly shown but ensured that repeated expressions are minimized.
- **Simplify Expressions**: The `CASE` statement in the final `SELECT` was removed because it was redundant given the filter `avg_monthly_sales > 0` in `v2`.
- **Efficient Use of Window Functions**: Kept as is but ensured they are only computed in the necessary subquery `v1`.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time and resource usage of the query.
