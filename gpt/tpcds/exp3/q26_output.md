To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be loaded and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to minimize the size of intermediate results. It can significantly reduce query execution time, especially in a query with multiple joins.

3. **Use of Proper Indexes**: Although not directly a rewrite rule, ensuring that the database has appropriate indexes can significantly speed up the execution of joins and filters.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Select only the columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in joins and conditions.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, 
    AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, 
    AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, 
    AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM 
    item
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2002
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
JOIN 
    promotion ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id 
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: I moved conditions related to `date_dim`, `customer_demographics`, and `promotion` directly into the respective JOIN clauses. This ensures that the filtering happens as early as possible, reducing the amount of data that flows through the subsequent parts of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: The query starts with the `item` table, which is likely smaller after filtering with `catalog_sales`, and then progressively joins other tables. This order might be adjusted based on actual table sizes and distribution, which are typically known through database statistics.

3. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: The SELECT and JOIN clauses only include the necessary columns for final output or conditions, reducing the data processing overhead.

By applying these rules, the query should execute more efficiently, especially on large datasets typical of TPC-DS benchmarks. Note that the actual performance can vary depending on the specific database schema indexes, statistics, and system configuration.
