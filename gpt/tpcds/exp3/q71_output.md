To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source in the query. It reduces the amount of data processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Projection Pushdown**: This involves reducing the number of columns retrieved in the subqueries to only those that are necessary for the final result. This minimizes the amount of data that needs to be processed and transferred.

3. **Join Reordering**: This involves rearranging the joins to minimize the size of intermediate results, which can reduce query execution times.

4. **Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: This can make the query more readable and potentially allow the optimizer to make better decisions about join orders and groupings.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the conditions `d_moy=12` and `d_year=2002` directly into the respective subqueries for `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `store_sales`.

2. **Projection Pushdown**: Only select the necessary columns in the subqueries.

3. **Use of CTEs**: Define CTEs for sales data to simplify the main query and potentially improve performance by allowing the optimizer to better understand the structure of the query.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH sales_data AS (
    SELECT ws_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, ws_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, ws_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, ws_sold_time_sk AS time_sk
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d_moy = 12 AND d_year = 2002

    UNION ALL

    SELECT cs_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, cs_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, cs_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, cs_sold_time_sk AS time_sk
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d_moy = 12 AND d_year = 2002

    UNION ALL

    SELECT ss_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, ss_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, ss_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, ss_sold_time_sk AS time_sk
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d_moy = 12 AND d_year = 2002
),
time_filtered AS (
    SELECT t_time_sk, t_hour, t_minute
    FROM time_dim
    WHERE t_meal_time = 'breakfast' OR t_meal_time = 'dinner'
)
SELECT i_brand_id AS brand_id, i_brand AS brand, t_hour, t_minute, SUM(ext_price) AS ext_price
FROM item
JOIN sales_data ON sold_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN time_filtered ON time_sk = t_time_sk
WHERE i_manager_id = 1
GROUP BY i_brand, i_brand_id, t_hour, t_minute
ORDER BY ext_price DESC, i_brand_id;
```

This optimized query uses CTEs to clarify the structure, applies predicate and projection pushdown to reduce the amount of data processed, and potentially allows the optimizer to make more efficient decisions regarding execution plans.
