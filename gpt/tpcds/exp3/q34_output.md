Apologies for the confusion. The "### Optimized Query" was intended as a markdown heading for clarity in the explanation, not as part of the SQL query. Here is the corrected and optimized SQL query without the markdown syntax:

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    c_salutation,
    c_preferred_cust_flag,
    ss_ticket_number,
    cnt
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
        JOIN household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    WHERE 
        (date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 3 OR date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 25 AND 28)
        AND (household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' OR household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '0-500')
        AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0
        AND (CASE WHEN household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 THEN household_demographics.hd_dep_count / household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count ELSE NULL END) > 1.2
        AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
        AND store.s_county = 'Williamson County'
    GROUP BY 
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk
) dn
JOIN customer ON dn.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
WHERE 
    cnt BETWEEN 15 AND 20
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    c_salutation,
    c_preferred_cust_flag DESC,
    ss_ticket_number;
```

This query should execute without syntax errors and provides an optimized version of the original query by applying the discussed optimization techniques.
