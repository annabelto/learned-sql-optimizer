To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify or precompute expressions where possible to reduce complexity during query execution.
3. **Eliminate Redundant Operations**: Remove unnecessary operations or calculations to streamline execution.
4. **Use Explicit Joins**: Replace implicit joins with explicit join syntax for better readability and potentially more efficient execution plans.

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Use of Explicit Joins**: Changed implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Simplify Expressions**: The `d_month_seq` condition was simplified using `BETWEEN` for better readability and potentially faster evaluation.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: All conditions are evaluated as early as possible in the query process, reducing the amount of data carried into the aggregate and window functions.
