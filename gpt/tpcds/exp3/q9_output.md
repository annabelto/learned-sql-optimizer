I apologize for the confusion in previous attempts. Let's ensure the optimized query maintains the logic of the original query while improving its efficiency.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query uses multiple subqueries to calculate conditional averages based on counts for different ranges of `ss_quantity`. Each bucket involves:
1. Counting entries within a specific range.
2. Depending on the count, either calculating the average of `ss_ext_tax` or `ss_net_paid_inc_tax` for the same range.

### Optimization Strategy
To optimize:
1. **Aggregate Once**: Compute counts, `avg(ss_ext_tax)`, and `avg(ss_net_paid_inc_tax)` in one pass grouped by range.
2. **Use Conditional Logic**: Apply the conditions on the aggregates directly.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH store_sales_summary AS (
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN '1-20'
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN '21-40'
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN '41-60'
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN '61-80'
            WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN '81-100'
        END AS quantity_range,
        COUNT(*) AS total_count,
        AVG(ss_ext_tax) AS avg_ext_tax,
        AVG(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) AS avg_net_paid_inc_tax
    FROM store_sales
    WHERE ss_quantity <= 100
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '1-20' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 1071 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket1,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '21-40' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 39161 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket2,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '41-60' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 29434 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket3,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '61-80' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 6568 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket4,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quantity_range = '81-100' THEN
        CASE WHEN total_count > 21216 THEN avg_ext_tax ELSE avg_net_paid_inc_tax END
    END) AS bucket5
FROM store_sales_summary
JOIN reason ON r_reason_sk = 1
WHERE quantity_range IS NOT NULL;
```

### Explanation
- **CTE `store_sales_summary`**: This common table expression pre-aggregates the data by `ss_quantity` ranges, calculating the count, average extended tax, and average net paid including tax for each range.
- **Final Selection**: For each bucket, the query uses conditional logic to decide which average value to use based on the count. The `MAX` function is used to ensure that only the relevant value for each range is selected (since there will be only one non-null value per bucket due to the `CASE` conditions).

This approach should ensure that the output matches the original query's logic while reducing the number of full table scans and computations needed.
