I apologize for the repeated issues. Let's ensure that the optimized query strictly adheres to the logic of the original query while applying optimization techniques correctly.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH item_filter AS (
    SELECT i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_color IN ('powder', 'orchid', 'pink')
),
ss AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 3 AND ca_gmt_offset = -6
      AND i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item_filter)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
cs AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON cs_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 3 AND ca_gmt_offset = -6
      AND i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item_filter)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
ws AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 3 AND ca_gmt_offset = -6
      AND i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM item_filter)
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT i_item_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM ss
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM cs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM ws
) AS combined_sales
GROUP BY i_item_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: The subquery that filters `i_item_id` based on `i_color` is extracted into a CTE (`item_filter`). This avoids repeated execution of the same subquery in each sales table join.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**: The filters for `d_year`, `d_moy`, and `ca_gmt_offset` are directly included in the join conditions for `date_dim` and `customer_address`. This reduces the number of rows early in the query execution process.

3. **Maintaining Original Logic**: The structure of the query, including the use of `UNION ALL` and the final aggregation, remains unchanged to ensure that the results are consistent with the original query.

This version should maintain the output consistency with the original query while potentially improving performance through reduced redundancy and more efficient filtering.
