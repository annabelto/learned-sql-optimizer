To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving predicates (filters) closer to the data source. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages of the query.

2. **Subquery Flattening**: This rule transforms subqueries into join operations when possible. Joins are generally more efficient than subqueries as they can be better optimized by the query planner.

3. **Use of IN to JOIN Conversion**: Convert the `IN` clause used for `i_item_id` to a `JOIN`, which can be more efficient as it allows the database to use indexes and hash joins.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Remove columns from the SELECT and JOIN clauses that are not needed for the final output or in subsequent operations.

5. **Order of Joins**: Rearrange joins to filter out rows as early as possible, especially based on highly selective conditions.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT ca_zip, ca_city, SUM(ws_sales_price)
FROM 
    web_sales
JOIN 
    customer ON ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2000
JOIN 
    item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT DISTINCT i_item_id FROM item WHERE i_item_sk IN (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)) AS item_filter ON item.i_item_id = item_filter.i_item_id
WHERE 
    (substr(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') OR item_filter.i_item_id IS NOT NULL)
GROUP BY 
    ca_zip, ca_city
ORDER BY 
    ca_zip, ca_city
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Joins instead of Subqueries**: The subquery for `i_item_id` has been converted into a `LEFT JOIN` with a derived table that includes distinct `i_item_id` values. This allows the database to potentially use a more efficient join strategy.
  
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `date_dim` (`d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2000`) are included in the `JOIN` clause, reducing the number of rows joined with other tables.

- **Order of Joins**: The joins are ordered to first reduce the dataset size based on highly selective filters (`date_dim` and `customer_address`), which should reduce the overall processing time.

This rewritten query should perform better due to more efficient use of joins and early application of filters, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and moved around during query execution.
