Apologies for the oversight. Let's revisit the optimization while ensuring the output remains consistent with the original query. We'll focus on maintaining the exact logical structure while applying optimizations that do not alter the results.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH amc AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS amc
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN household_demographics ON ws_ship_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    JOIN time_dim ON ws_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk
    JOIN web_page ON ws_web_page_sk = web_page.wp_web_page_sk
    WHERE time_dim.t_hour BETWEEN 12 AND 13
      AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 6
      AND web_page.wp_char_count BETWEEN 5000 AND 5200
),
pmc AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS pmc
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN household_demographics ON ws_ship_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    JOIN time_dim ON ws_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk
    JOIN web_page ON ws_web_page_sk = web_page.wp_web_page_sk
    WHERE time_dim.t_hour BETWEEN 14 AND 15
      AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 6
      AND web_page.wp_char_count BETWEEN 5000 AND 5200
)
SELECT
    CAST(amc.amc AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(pmc.pmc AS DECIMAL(15,4)) AS am_pm_ratio
FROM
    amc, pmc
ORDER BY
    am_pm_ratio DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Used `WITH` clauses for `amc` and `pmc` to clearly separate the logic for counts in the AM and PM periods. This makes the query more readable and maintains the logical separation as in the original query.
- **Join Optimization**: Changed implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax, which is generally more readable and preferred in SQL for clarity.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Ensured that all relevant conditions are directly in the `JOIN` and `WHERE` clauses to minimize the number of rows processed early in the execution.
- **Maintain Original Logic**: Kept the structure and logic identical to the original query to ensure the output matches exactly, focusing on readability and slight performance improvements without altering the result set.

This revised query should perform similarly to the original while being slightly more readable and maintaining the exact output.
