I apologize for the repeated issues. Let's carefully review and ensure that the optimized query maintains the exact logic of the original query, ensuring that the output matches exactly.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH wscs AS (
    SELECT sold_date_sk, sales_price
    FROM (
        SELECT ws_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, ws_ext_sales_price AS sales_price
        FROM web_sales
        UNION ALL
        SELECT cs_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, cs_ext_sales_price AS sales_price
        FROM catalog_sales
    ) AS foo
),
wswscs AS (
    SELECT d_week_seq,
           SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Sunday' THEN sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sun_sales,
           SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Monday' THEN sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS mon_sales,
           SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Tuesday' THEN sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS tue_sales,
           SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Wednesday' THEN sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS wed_sales,
           SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Thursday' THEN sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS thu_sales,
           SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Friday' THEN sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS fri_sales,
           SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name = 'Saturday' THEN sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sat_sales
    FROM wscs
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = sold_date_sk
    GROUP BY d_week_seq
)
SELECT d_week_seq1,
       ROUND(sun_sales1 / NULLIF(sun_sales2, 0), 2) AS sun_ratio,
       ROUND(mon_sales1 / NULLIF(mon_sales2, 0), 2) AS mon_ratio,
       ROUND(tue_sales1 / NULLIF(tue_sales2, 0), 2) AS tue_ratio,
       ROUND(wed_sales1 / NULLIF(wed_sales2, 0), 2) AS wed_ratio,
       ROUND(thu_sales1 / NULLIF(thu_sales2, 0), 2) AS thu_ratio,
       ROUND(fri_sales1 / NULLIF(fri_sales2, 0), 2) AS fri_ratio,
       ROUND(sat_sales1 / NULLIF(sat_sales2, 0), 2) AS sat_ratio
FROM (
    SELECT wswscs.d_week_seq AS d_week_seq1, sun_sales AS sun_sales1, mon_sales AS mon_sales1,
           tue_sales AS tue_sales1, wed_sales AS wed_sales1, thu_sales AS thu_sales1,
           fri_sales AS fri_sales1, sat_sales AS sat_sales1
    FROM wswscs
    JOIN date_dim ON date_dim.d_week_seq = wswscs.d_week_seq
    WHERE date_dim.d_year = 1998
) y
JOIN (
    SELECT wswscs.d_week_seq AS d_week_seq2, sun_sales AS sun_sales2, mon_sales AS mon_sales2,
           tue_sales AS tue_sales2, wed_sales AS wed_sales2, thu_sales AS thu_sales2,
           fri_sales AS fri_sales2, sat_sales AS sat_sales2
    FROM wswscs
    JOIN date_dim ON date_dim.d_week_seq = wswscs.d_week_seq
    WHERE date_dim.d_year = 1999
) z ON d_week_seq1 = d_week_seq2 - 53
ORDER BY d_week_seq1;
```

This query should now accurately reflect the original query's logic, ensuring that the output matches while incorporating optimizations for better performance. The key adjustments include ensuring the correct handling of NULL values and zero denominators in ratio calculations, and maintaining the integrity of the original query's joins and filters.
