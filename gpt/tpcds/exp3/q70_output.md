To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules applied include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving filter conditions as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by reusing the results of sub-expressions that are computed more than once.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated to reduce complexity.

4. **Simplifying Aggregations**: Aggregations that are not necessary or can be simplified without changing the semantics of the query should be optimized.

5. **Using Efficient SQL Constructs**: Replacing certain SQL constructs with more efficient ones based on the specific database system's optimization capabilities.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    total_sum,
    s_state,
    s_county,
    lochierarchy,
    rank_within_parent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS total_sum,
        s_state,
        s_county,
        grouping(s_state) + grouping(s_county) AS lochierarchy,
        rank() OVER (
            PARTITION BY grouping(s_state) + grouping(s_county), 
            CASE WHEN grouping(s_county) = 0 THEN s_state END 
            ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) DESC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
    JOIN 
        date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231
        AND s_state IN (
            SELECT 
                s_state
            FROM (
                SELECT 
                    s_state,
                    SUM(ss_net_profit) AS state_profit
                FROM 
                    store_sales
                JOIN 
                    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
                JOIN 
                    date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
                WHERE 
                    d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231
                GROUP BY 
                    s_state
                ORDER BY 
                    state_profit DESC
                LIMIT 5
            ) AS top_states
        )
    GROUP BY 
        ROLLUP(s_state, s_county)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    lochierarchy DESC,
    CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN s_state END,
    rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the `d_month_seq` filter closer to the `date_dim` table in the subquery to reduce the rows processed early.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: The subquery calculating state profits is used to filter states in the main query, avoiding recalculations.
3. **Join Elimination**: Not applied as all joins contribute to the result.
4. **Simplifying Aggregations**: The aggregation in the subquery is directly used for filtering, avoiding unnecessary ranking operations.
5. **Using Efficient SQL Constructs**: Used explicit JOINs instead of commas for clarity and potential performance benefits in some SQL engines.

These optimizations aim to streamline the execution by reducing the amount of data shuffled and processed, leveraging indexing, and minimizing the computational overhead.
