To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent steps.
2. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate redundant subqueries or calculations to avoid repeated work.
3. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if they do not contribute to the final result.
4. **Column Pruning**: Select only the necessary columns in the subqueries to reduce the amount of data being processed.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH my_customers AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
    FROM (
        SELECT cs_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, cs_bill_customer_sk AS customer_sk, cs_item_sk AS item_sk
        FROM catalog_sales
        WHERE cs_sold_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_moy = 1 AND d_year = 1999)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT ws_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, ws_bill_customer_sk AS customer_sk, ws_item_sk AS item_sk
        FROM web_sales
        WHERE ws_sold_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_moy = 1 AND d_year = 1999)
    ) AS cs_or_ws_sales
    JOIN item ON cs_or_ws_sales.item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN customer ON c_customer_sk = cs_or_ws_sales.customer_sk
    WHERE i_category = 'Music' AND i_class = 'country'
),
my_revenue AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS revenue
    FROM my_customers
    JOIN store_sales ON c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN store ON ca_county = s_county AND ca_state = s_state
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN (
        SELECT MIN(d_month_seq) + 1
        FROM date_dim
        WHERE d_year = 1999 AND d_moy = 1
    ) AND (
        SELECT MAX(d_month_seq) + 3
        FROM date_dim
        WHERE d_year = 1999 AND d_moy = 1
    )
    GROUP BY c_customer_sk
),
segments AS (
    SELECT CAST((revenue / 50) AS int) AS segment
    FROM my_revenue
)
SELECT segment, COUNT(*) AS num_customers, segment * 50 AS segment_base
FROM segments
GROUP BY segment
ORDER BY segment, num_customers
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the date-related conditions (`d_moy = 1 AND d_year = 1999`) directly into the subqueries for `catalog_sales` and `web_sales`. This reduces the amount of data joined with `item` and `customer`.

2. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: The subqueries calculating `d_month_seq + 1` and `d_month_seq + 3` are simplified by using `MIN` and `MAX` functions, assuming that `d_month_seq` increments consistently.

3. **Column Pruning**: Removed unnecessary columns from the SELECT clauses in the subqueries, keeping only those required for joins and conditions.

4. **Join Elimination**: Not applied here as all joins contribute to the final result.

These optimizations should help reduce the execution time and resource usage of the query by minimizing the amount of data processed and transferred across different parts of the query.
