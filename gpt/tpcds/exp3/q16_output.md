To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates, which can reduce the amount of data scanned and processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Remove or simplify redundant expressions to reduce the complexity of the query.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not affect the result, it can be removed to simplify the query.

4. **Simplifying IN Clauses**: Simplify the IN clause if it contains duplicate values.

5. **Use of Explicit JOINs**: Convert implicit joins (comma-separated in FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control.

### Applying the Rules:

**Step 1: Predicate Pushdown**
- Move the conditions related to `date_dim`, `customer_address`, and `call_center` directly into the respective JOIN conditions.

**Step 2: Redundant Expression Elimination**
- The `IN` clause for `cc_county` contains duplicate values. This can be simplified.

**Step 3: Simplifying IN Clauses**
- Simplify the `IN` clause for `cc_county` to contain only unique values.

**Step 4: Use of Explicit JOINs**
- Convert the query to use explicit JOIN syntax.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT cs1.cs_order_number) AS "order count",
    SUM(cs1.cs_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
    SUM(cs1.cs_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM 
    catalog_sales cs1
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs1.cs_ship_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    AND date_dim.d_date BETWEEN '2002-4-01' AND (CAST('2002-4-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 days')
JOIN 
    customer_address ON cs1.cs_ship_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
    AND customer_address.ca_state = 'PA'
JOIN 
    call_center ON cs1.cs_call_center_sk = call_center.cc_call_center_sk
    AND call_center.cc_county = 'Williamson County'
WHERE 
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM catalog_sales cs2
        WHERE cs1.cs_order_number = cs2.cs_order_number
          AND cs1.cs_warehouse_sk <> cs2.cs_warehouse_sk
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM catalog_returns cr1
        WHERE cs1.cs_order_number = cr1.cr_order_number
    )
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(DISTINCT cs1.cs_order_number)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit JOINs** are used instead of commas in the FROM clause, which makes the query easier to read and manage.
- **Predicate Pushdown** is applied by moving conditions into the JOIN clauses.
- **Redundant Expression Elimination** and **Simplifying IN Clauses** are used to clean up the `cc_county` condition.
- The query now should perform better due to reduced data shuffling and more efficient use of indexes (if available).
