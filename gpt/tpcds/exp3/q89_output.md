To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions into the subquery to reduce the number of rows processed in the outer query and during joins.
2. **Join Elimination**: If possible, eliminate unnecessary joins that do not affect the result.
3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control.
4. **Column Pruning**: Select only the necessary columns in the subquery to reduce the amount of data processed and transferred.
5. **Simplification of Expressions**: Simplify or reorganize expressions for clarity and potential performance benefits.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query joins several tables and performs aggregation and window functions. It filters based on specific years and categories, and then computes a complex condition in the outer query.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Push the conditions related to `d_year`, `i_category`, and `i_class` into the subquery to reduce the dataset early in the execution plan.

2. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert the implicit joins to explicit joins to clarify the join conditions and potentially aid the optimizer.

3. **Column Pruning**: In the subquery, only select the columns necessary for the final output or conditions, avoiding the retrieval of extra data.

4. **Simplification of Expressions**: The CASE expression in the WHERE clause of the outer query can be simplified by directly filtering on the computed condition.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_category, 
    i_class, 
    i_brand, 
    s_store_name, 
    s_company_name, 
    d_moy, 
    sum_sales, 
    avg_monthly_sales
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_moy, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name
        ) AS avg_monthly_sales
    FROM 
        item
        JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001 AND
        (
            (i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('history', 'school-uniforms', 'audio')) OR
            (i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Shoes') AND i_class IN ('pants', 'tennis', 'womens'))
        )
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_moy
) AS tmp1
WHERE 
    (avg_monthly_sales <> 0 AND ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales > 0.1)
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation
- **Explicit JOINs** are used instead of commas for clarity.
- **Predicate pushdown** is applied to filter rows as early as possible.
- **Column pruning** is inherently handled as we only select necessary columns.
- **Simplified the CASE expression** in the WHERE clause to directly use the condition, improving readability and potentially aiding optimization by the query planner.
