To optimize the given PostgreSQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include predicate pushdown, join elimination, and using explicit joins over implicit joins. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be loaded and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Explicit Join Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax. This makes the query easier to read and understand, and in some cases, can help the database optimize the join order and execution.

3. **Date Calculation Optimization**: Pre-calculate the date range outside the query to avoid repeated calculations for each row.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_item_id,
    i.i_item_desc,
    i.i_category,
    i.i_class,
    i.i_current_price,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i.i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    store_sales ss
JOIN 
    item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Jewelry')
    AND d.d_date BETWEEN '1999-02-05'::date AND ('1999-02-05'::date + INTERVAL '30 days')
GROUP BY 
    i.i_item_id, i.i_item_desc, i.i_category, i.i_class, i.i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i.i_category, i.i_class, i.i_item_id, i.i_item_desc, revenueratio;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit INNER JOINs for clarity and potential optimization benefits.
- **Date Calculation**: The date range is calculated directly in the WHERE clause using PostgreSQL's date and interval functionality, avoiding repeated calculations.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The filtering conditions on `i_category` and `d_date` are applied directly after the joins, which helps in reducing the amount of data processed in the subsequent stages of the query.

These changes should help in improving the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data being processed and making the execution plan more efficient.
