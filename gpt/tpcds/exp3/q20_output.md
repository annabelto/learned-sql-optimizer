To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data scanned and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated. However, in this query, all joins are necessary for the final result.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax. This improves readability and can help the database optimizer understand the query structure better.

4. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify and clarify any complex expressions if possible, though in this query, expressions are already quite optimized.

5. **Column Pruning**: Only select columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in JOIN/PREDICATE conditions.

6. **Index Usage**: Ensure that indexes are available on the columns used in JOIN and WHERE conditions, especially on `cs_item_sk`, `i_item_sk`, `cs_sold_date_sk`, and `d_date_sk`.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_item_id,
    i.i_item_desc,
    i.i_category,
    i.i_class,
    i.i_current_price,
    SUM(cs.cs_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(cs.cs_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(cs.cs_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i.i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    catalog_sales cs
JOIN 
    item i ON cs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_category IN ('Books', 'Music', 'Sports')
    AND d.d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-06-18' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-06-18' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30 days')
GROUP BY 
    i.i_item_id,
    i.i_item_desc,
    i.i_category,
    i.i_class,
    i.i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i.i_category,
    i.i_class,
    i.i_item_id,
    i.i_item_desc,
    revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for better readability and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Date Range Condition**: Simplified the date range condition by using `INTERVAL` for adding days directly to a date.
- **Column and Table Aliases**: Used shorter aliases for tables to make the query more readable.

These changes should help in optimizing the query execution by making better use of indexes and reducing the amount of data processed.
