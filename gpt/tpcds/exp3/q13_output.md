To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the complexity and improving the performance of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be loaded and processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Conjunction Normal Form (CNF)**: Rewriting the WHERE clause conditions to a standardized format can help the database optimizer better understand and optimize the query.

3. **Simplifying OR conditions**: By analyzing the conditions within the OR clauses, we can sometimes simplify or reorganize them to make the query more efficient.

4. **Use of IN instead of multiple ORs**: When checking for equality against multiple values, using IN can be more readable and sometimes more efficient than multiple OR conditions.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(ss_quantity),
    AVG(ss_ext_sales_price),
    AVG(ss_ext_wholesale_cost),
    SUM(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = ss_cdemo_sk
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    (
        (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'College' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 100.00 AND 150.00 AND hd_dep_count = 3) OR
        (cd_marital_status = 'D' AND cd_education_status = 'Primary' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00 AND hd_dep_count = 1) OR
        (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 150.00 AND 200.00 AND hd_dep_count = 1)
    ) AND
    ca_country = 'United States' AND
    (
        (ca_state IN ('IL', 'TN', 'TX') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 100 AND 200) OR
        (ca_state IN ('WY', 'OH', 'ID') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 150 AND 300) OR
        (ca_state IN ('MS', 'SC', 'IA') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 50 AND 250)
    );
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Joins instead of commas**: Changed the implicit joins (comma-separated tables) to explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved conditions related to specific tables directly into the JOIN conditions where possible.
- **Simplification and Standardization**: Grouped conditions logically and used IN for state conditions to simplify the query and potentially improve performance by allowing the use of indexes.
