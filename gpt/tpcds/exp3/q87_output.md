I apologize for the confusion caused by the formatting in my previous responses. Let's provide the optimized query without any formatting errors in the SQL code itself.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1202 AND 1213

    EXCEPT

    SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1202 AND 1213

    EXCEPT

    SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer ON web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE date_dim.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1202 AND 1213
) AS cool_cust;
```

This query maintains the original structure using `EXCEPT` to filter out records from `store_sales` that also appear in `catalog_sales` or `web_sales`, based on distinct combinations of `c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, and `d_date`. The `WHERE` clause condition is applied directly in each subquery to reduce the number of rows processed, optimizing the query while preserving its original logic.
