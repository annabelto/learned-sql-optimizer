To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance by reducing the amount of data processed and simplifying operations. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to where the data originates. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**: Remove or simplify redundant expressions or conditions to streamline the execution.

3. **Constant Folding**: Evaluate expressions involving constants at compile time rather than at runtime.

4. **Simplifying Boolean Expressions**: Simplify complex Boolean expressions where possible.

5. **Removing Duplicate Conditions**: Eliminate any duplicate conditions in the query.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   - Push the conditions related to `date_dim`, `store`, and `household_demographics` directly into the subquery. This reduces the rows early on.

2. **Redundant Expression Elimination**:
   - The condition `date_dim.d_year in (2000,2000+1,2000+2)` simplifies to `date_dim.d_year in (2000, 2001, 2002)`.
   - The condition `store.s_county in ('Williamson County', 'Williamson County', 'Williamson County', 'Williamson County')` simplifies to `store.s_county = 'Williamson County'`.

3. **Constant Folding**:
   - Directly replace `2000+1` and `2000+2` with `2001` and `2002`.

4. **Simplifying Boolean Expressions**:
   - The expression `(household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' or household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '5001-10000')` can be left as is since it's already simplified.

5. **Removing Duplicate Conditions**:
   - Remove duplicate values in the `IN` list for `store.s_county`.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag, ss_ticket_number, cnt
FROM (
    SELECT ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics
    WHERE store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
      AND store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
      AND store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
      AND date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
      AND (household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' OR household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '5001-10000')
      AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0
      AND CASE 
            WHEN household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 THEN household_demographics.hd_dep_count / household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count 
            ELSE NULL 
          END > 1
      AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
      AND store.s_county = 'Williamson County'
    GROUP BY ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk
) dj, customer
WHERE ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND cnt BETWEEN 1 AND 5
ORDER BY cnt DESC, c_last_name ASC;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data scanning and processing, and simplified conditions.
