Apologies for the confusion. Let's provide the optimized query without any formatting issues.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_desc,
    w_warehouse_name,
    d1.d_week_seq,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo,
    COUNT(*) AS total_cnt
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    inventory ON cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk
JOIN 
    warehouse ON w_warehouse_sk = inv_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk AND hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000'
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk AND d1.d_year = 1998
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    promotion ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    catalog_returns ON cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND cr_order_number = cs_order_number
WHERE 
    inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity
GROUP BY 
    i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq
ORDER BY 
    total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Optimizations
1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Filters such as `d1.d_year = 1998`, `cd_marital_status = 'S'`, and `hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000'` are pushed down into the respective `JOIN` conditions to reduce the number of rows processed.
2. **Join Reordering**: The joins are reordered to ensure that the filtering conditions on `date_dim` are applied as early as possible, which can significantly reduce the number of rows in subsequent joins.
3. **Simplification of Conditions**: The condition `d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5` is moved to the join condition with `date_dim d3` to ensure it is evaluated at the time of the join, reducing intermediate result sizes.

This query should perform better by reducing the amount of data being processed at each step and ensuring that the most restrictive filters are applied early in the execution plan.
