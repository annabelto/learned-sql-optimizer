Apologies for the oversight in the previous query. Let's correct the join condition and ensure the query is syntactically correct.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),
ss AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
    WHERE item.i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM filtered_items)
      AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 10 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
cs AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON cs_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
    WHERE item.i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM filtered_items)
      AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 10 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i_item_id
),
ws AS (
    SELECT i_item_id, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
    WHERE item.i_item_id IN (SELECT i_item_id FROM filtered_items)
      AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 10 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i_item_id
)
SELECT i_item_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM ss
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM cs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM ws
) AS combined_sales
GROUP BY i_item_id
ORDER BY i_item_id, total_sales
LIMIT 100;
```

**Corrections Made:**
- **Join Condition Fixed**: The join condition between the sales tables (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`) and the `item` table has been corrected to use the correct column names.
- **Subquery for `i_item_id`**: Instead of joining directly on `filtered_items`, the query now filters `i_item_id` using a subquery that checks if `i_item_id` exists in the `filtered_items`. This ensures that the join conditions are correctly specified and the query executes without errors.

These corrections should resolve the syntax errors and optimize the query execution by reducing the amount of data processed through the use of a common sub-expression and predicate pushdown.
