To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if the joined table columns are not used elsewhere in the query or if the join does not affect the result.

3. **Subquery Flattening**: Convert correlated subqueries to joins where possible, which can be more efficiently executed by the database.

4. **Removing Redundant Ordering**: Since the `ORDER BY` clause uses the same expression as one of the selected columns and there is a `LIMIT` clause, the ordering is necessary. However, ensure that the ordering does not involve unnecessary columns.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   - Push the conditions related to `date_dim`, `customer_address`, and `web_site` directly into the respective joins.

2. **Join Elimination**:
   - All joins seem necessary for the final result as they are used in the WHERE clause conditions or are essential for filtering based on the query's logic.

3. **Subquery Flattening**:
   - The `EXISTS` subquery can be rewritten as a join, although it's a semi-join (filtering based on existence). We will keep it as is because PostgreSQL handles semi-joins efficiently with `EXISTS`.

4. **Removing Redundant Ordering**:
   - The `ORDER BY` clause is necessary due to the `LIMIT` clause, but ensure it's optimized by the database.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number) AS "order count",
    SUM(ws1.ws_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
    SUM(ws1.ws_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM
    web_sales ws1
JOIN
    date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
JOIN
    customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN
    web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site.web_site_sk
WHERE
    date_dim.d_date BETWEEN '2002-5-01' AND (CAST('2002-5-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 days')
    AND customer_address.ca_state = 'OK'
    AND web_site.web_company_name = 'pri'
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM web_sales ws2
        WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
          AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM web_returns wr1
        WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number
    )
ORDER BY
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number)
LIMIT 100;
```

This rewritten query applies the discussed optimizations. The `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries are left as is because they are already in a semi-join form, which PostgreSQL can optimize. The joins are explicitly stated, and the filtering conditions are pushed down to reduce the amount of data processed.
