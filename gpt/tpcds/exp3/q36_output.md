To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: The `s_state` filter condition contains multiple redundant values. We can simplify this to a single condition.
2. **Simplify Grouping Operations**: The `grouping()` function is used multiple times with the same arguments. We can compute it once and reuse the result.
3. **Column Pruning**: The outer query selects all columns from the subquery, but only a few are actually used in the final output or ordering. We can limit the columns in the inner query to those necessary.
4. **Use of Aliases for Clarity**: Introduce aliases for tables and computed columns to make the query more readable and maintainable.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    gross_margin,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    lochierarchy,
    rank_within_parent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ss_net_profit) / SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS gross_margin,
        i_category,
        i_class,
        grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class) AS lochierarchy,
        rank() OVER (
            PARTITION BY grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class), 
            CASE WHEN grouping(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END 
            ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) / SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) ASC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
        JOIN item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
        JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d1.d_year = 2000 
        AND s_state = 'TN'
    GROUP BY 
        ROLLUP(i_category, i_class)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    lochierarchy DESC,
    CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END,
    rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Changed `s_state in ('TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN')` to `s_state = 'TN'`.
- **Simplify Grouping Operations**: Used `grouping()` directly in the `PARTITION BY` clause of the window function.
- **Column Pruning**: Removed `SELECT *` and specified only necessary columns in the outer query to avoid unnecessary data processing.
- **Use of Aliases**: Added aliases (`d1` for `date_dim`, `item`, and `store`) to improve readability.

These optimizations should help in reducing the computational overhead and improving the clarity and efficiency of the query.
