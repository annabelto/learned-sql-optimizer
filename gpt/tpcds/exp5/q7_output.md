To optimize the given query, I will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    AVG(ss_quantity) AS agg1, 
    AVG(ss_list_price) AS agg2, 
    AVG(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, 
    AVG(ss_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN 
    promotion ON ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
WHERE 
    cd_gender = 'F' 
    AND cd_marital_status = 'W' 
    AND cd_education_status = 'College' 
    AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N') 
    AND d_year = 2001 
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id 
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax, specifying the join conditions using the ON keyword. This makes the query easier to read and understand, and it explicitly defines how the tables are related.
- **Rule 6:** I moved all join-related conditions from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses in the JOINs. This helps in potentially reducing the dataset earlier in the execution plan, which can improve performance as the join operations can be more efficiently executed with smaller datasets.

This rewritten query now uses explicit JOIN syntax and has all join conditions specified in the ON clauses, adhering to best practices for SQL query writing and potentially improving performance by making better use of indexes and reducing the size of intermediate datasets.
