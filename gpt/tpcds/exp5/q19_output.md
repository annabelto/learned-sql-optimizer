To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
    i_brand AS brand, 
    i_manufact_id, 
    i_manufact, 
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price 
FROM 
    date_dim
JOIN 
    store_sales ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk AND substr(ca_zip, 1, 5) <> substr(s_zip, 1, 5)
WHERE 
    i_manager_id = 14 
    AND d_moy = 11 
    AND d_year = 2002
GROUP BY 
    i_brand, 
    i_brand_id, 
    i_manufact_id, 
    i_manufact
ORDER BY 
    ext_price DESC, 
    i_brand, 
    i_brand_id, 
    i_manufact_id, 
    i_manufact
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit Join Syntax:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
- **Explicit Join Conditions:** I moved the conditions that link the tables directly into the ON clauses of the respective JOINs.
- **Conditions Moved to ON Clauses:** Conditions that logically belong to specific table relationships, such as `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk` and the ZIP code comparison, are moved to the ON clause to clarify the join conditions and potentially improve performance by reducing the number of rows joined.
- **Filter Conditions in WHERE Clause:** Conditions that filter the result set but are not part of the joins remain in the WHERE clause.

This restructuring makes the query easier to read and understand, and it may also help the database optimizer to create a more efficient execution plan.
