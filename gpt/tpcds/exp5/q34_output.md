To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Application of Rules:

1. **Replace comma-separated tables with explicit JOIN syntax**: This makes the query easier to read and understand, aligning with standard SQL practices.
2. **Convert implicit joins (using WHERE) to explicit JOINs**: This involves changing the way tables are joined from using WHERE conditions to explicit ON conditions in JOIN clauses.
3. **Move conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause in JOINs**: This helps in improving the performance as the join conditions are evaluated earlier in the query execution plan.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    c_salutation,
    c_preferred_cust_flag,
    ss_ticket_number,
    cnt
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            ss_ticket_number,
            ss_customer_sk,
            count(*) AS cnt
        FROM 
            store_sales
        JOIN 
            date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
        JOIN 
            store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
        JOIN 
            household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
        WHERE 
            (date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 3 OR date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 25 AND 28)
            AND (household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' OR household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '0-500')
            AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0
            AND (CASE 
                    WHEN household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 THEN household_demographics.hd_dep_count / household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count 
                    ELSE NULL 
                 END) > 1.2
            AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
            AND store.s_county IN ('Williamson County')
        GROUP BY 
            ss_ticket_number, 
            ss_customer_sk
    ) AS dn
JOIN 
    customer ON dn.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
WHERE 
    cnt BETWEEN 15 AND 20
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    c_salutation,
    c_preferred_cust_flag DESC,
    ss_ticket_number;
```

**Explanation**:
- **Explicit JOINs** are used instead of listing tables in the FROM clause separated by commas.
- **Conditions** that link tables are moved to the ON clause of the corresponding JOIN.
- **Filter conditions** that do not link tables directly remain in the WHERE clause.
- **Redundant values** in the list for `store.s_county` are reduced to a single 'Williamson County' for clarity and efficiency.
