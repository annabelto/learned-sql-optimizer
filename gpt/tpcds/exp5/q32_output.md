To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
WHERE i_manufact_id = 722
  AND d_date BETWEEN '2001-03-09' AND (CAST('2001-03-09' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 days')
  AND cs_ext_discount_amt > (
    SELECT 1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt)
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
      AND d_date BETWEEN '2001-03-09' AND (CAST('2001-03-09' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 days')
  )
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**: I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and specified the join conditions using the ON keyword. This clarifies how the tables are related and ensures that the joins are correctly understood by the database engine.
- **Rule 6**: I moved the conditions that relate to how the tables are joined from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs. This can help the database optimizer by reducing the dataset early during the join process rather than after all joins have been processed.

These changes should make the query more readable and potentially improve its performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the join operations more effectively.
