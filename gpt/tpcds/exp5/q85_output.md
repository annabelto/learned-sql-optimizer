To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    substr(r_reason_desc, 1, 20),
    avg(ws_quantity),
    avg(wr_refunded_cash),
    avg(wr_fee)
FROM 
    web_sales
JOIN 
    web_returns ON ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk AND ws_order_number = wr_order_number
JOIN 
    web_page ON ws_web_page_sk = wp_web_page_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 1998
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd1 ON cd1.cd_demo_sk = wr_refunded_cdemo_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd2 ON cd2.cd_demo_sk = wr_returning_cdemo_sk AND cd1.cd_marital_status = cd2.cd_marital_status AND cd1.cd_education_status = cd2.cd_education_status
JOIN 
    customer_address ON ca_address_sk = wr_refunded_addr_sk
JOIN 
    reason ON r_reason_sk = wr_reason_sk
WHERE 
    (
        (cd1.cd_marital_status = 'D' AND cd1.cd_education_status = 'Primary' AND ws_sales_price BETWEEN 100.00 AND 150.00) OR
        (cd1.cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd1.cd_education_status = 'College' AND ws_sales_price BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00) OR
        (cd1.cd_marital_status = 'U' AND cd1.cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree' AND ws_sales_price BETWEEN 150.00 AND 200.00)
    ) AND
    (
        (ca_country = 'United States' AND ca_state IN ('NC', 'TX', 'IA') AND ws_net_profit BETWEEN 100 AND 200) OR
        (ca_country = 'United States' AND ca_state IN ('WI', 'WV', 'GA') AND ws_net_profit BETWEEN 150 AND 300) OR
        (ca_country = 'United States' AND ca_state IN ('OK', 'VA', 'KY') AND ws_net_profit BETWEEN 50 AND 250)
    )
GROUP BY 
    r_reason_desc
ORDER BY 
    substr(r_reason_desc, 1, 20),
    avg(ws_quantity),
    avg(wr_refunded_cash),
    avg(wr_fee)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs, specifying the join conditions using the ON keyword. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** I moved conditions that are directly related to the join logic from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses of the JOINs. This can help the query optimizer by reducing the number of rows early in the join process before applying further filters in the WHERE clause.
