To optimize the given query, I will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, 
    AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, 
    AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, 
    AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN 
    item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    promotion ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
WHERE 
    cd_gender = 'M' 
    AND cd_marital_status = 'W' 
    AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown' 
    AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N')
    AND d_year = 2002 
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id 
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Explicit Join Syntax**: I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions**: Each join now clearly specifies the condition under which the tables are linked, using the ON keyword.
3. **Conditions Moved to ON Clause**: Where applicable, conditions that directly relate to the join logic are moved to the ON clause of the respective JOIN. However, in this case, the conditions related to filtering specific demographic and promotion characteristics remain in the WHERE clause as they do not directly pertain to how the tables are joined but rather to how the data is filtered post-join.
4. **Filtering and Grouping**: The WHERE clause now purely contains conditions for filtering the data, and the GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses are used as before to aggregate and sort the data.

This optimized query should be more readable and potentially allow the database engine to optimize the execution plan better, especially in how joins are executed and how data is filtered and aggregated.
