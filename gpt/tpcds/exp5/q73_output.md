To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag, ss_ticket_number, cnt 
from (
    select ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, count(*) cnt 
    from store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics 
    where store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk 
      and store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk 
      and store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk 
      and date_dim.d_dom between 1 and 2 
      and (household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' or household_demographics.hd_buy_potential = '5001-10000') 
      and household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 
      and case when household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 then household_demographics.hd_dep_count / household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count else null end > 1 
      and date_dim.d_year in (2000, 2001, 2002) 
      and store.s_county in ('Williamson County') 
    group by ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk
) dj, customer 
where ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk 
  and cnt between 1 and 5 
order by cnt desc, c_last_name asc;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag, ss_ticket_number, cnt 
FROM (
    SELECT ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, count(*) AS cnt 
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
    JOIN household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    WHERE date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2 
      AND household_demographics.hd_buy_potential IN ('1001-5000', '5001-10000')
      AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 
      AND CASE WHEN household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 0 THEN household_demographics.hd_dep_count / household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count ELSE NULL END > 1 
      AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002) 
      AND store.s_county = 'Williamson County'
    GROUP BY ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk
) dj
JOIN customer ON dj.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
WHERE cnt BETWEEN 1 AND 5 
ORDER BY cnt DESC, c_last_name ASC;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that are directly related to the join logic are moved to the ON clause to clarify the relationship between tables and potentially improve join performance.
- **Simplification:** I simplified the repeated 'Williamson County' in the IN clause to a single equality check since all values were the same. Also, I used the IN clause for `hd_buy_potential` to make the query more concise and potentially easier for the optimizer to handle.
