To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select w_state, i_item_id,
       sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) < cast('2001-05-02' as date))
                then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_before,
       sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) >= cast('2001-05-02' as date))
                then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_after
from catalog_sales
left outer join catalog_returns on (cs_order_number = cr_order_number and cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk),
     warehouse,
     item,
     date_dim
where i_current_price between 0.99 and 1.49
  and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
  and cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
  and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  and d_date between (cast('2001-05-02' as date) - 30) and (cast('2001-05-02' as date) + 30)
group by w_state, i_item_id
order by w_state, i_item_id
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
select w_state, i_item_id,
       sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) < cast('2001-05-02' as date))
                then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_before,
       sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) >= cast('2001-05-02' as date))
                then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_after
from catalog_sales
left outer join catalog_returns on cs_order_number = cr_order_number and cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk
join item on i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
join warehouse on cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
join date_dim on cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
where i_current_price between 0.99 and 1.49
  and d_date between (cast('2001-05-02' as date) - 30) and (cast('2001-05-02' as date) + 30)
group by w_state, i_item_id
order by w_state, i_item_id
limit 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses of the JOINs. This clarifies the relationships between the tables and ensures that the optimizer understands the intended joins.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that were directly related to the joins were moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clauses, which can help in optimizing the join operation by reducing the number of rows combined before applying other filters.

This rewritten query should be more efficient and clearer in expressing the intended data relationships and constraints.
