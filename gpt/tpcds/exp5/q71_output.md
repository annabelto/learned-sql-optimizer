To optimize the given TPC-DS query, I will apply the provided data-independent rewrite rules in a logical sequence to improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
    i.i_brand AS brand,
    t.t_hour,
    t.t_minute, 
    SUM(tmp.ext_price) AS ext_price 
FROM 
    item i
JOIN 
    (SELECT 
        ws.ws_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, 
        ws.ws_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, 
        ws.ws_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, 
        ws.ws_sold_time_sk AS time_sk 
     FROM 
        web_sales ws
     JOIN 
        date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ws.ws_sold_date_sk
     WHERE 
        d.d_moy = 12 AND d.d_year = 2002
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT 
        cs.cs_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, 
        cs.cs_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, 
        cs.cs_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, 
        cs.cs_sold_time_sk AS time_sk 
     FROM 
        catalog_sales cs
     JOIN 
        date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = cs.cs_sold_date_sk
     WHERE 
        d.d_moy = 12 AND d.d_year = 2002
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT 
        ss.ss_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, 
        ss.ss_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, 
        ss.ss_item_sk AS sold_item_sk, 
        ss.ss_sold_time_sk AS time_sk 
     FROM 
        store_sales ss
     JOIN 
        date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
     WHERE 
        d.d_moy = 12 AND d.d_year = 2002
    ) tmp ON tmp.sold_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN 
    time_dim t ON tmp.time_sk = t.t_time_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_manager_id = 1 
    AND (t.t_meal_time = 'breakfast' OR t.t_meal_time = 'dinner')
GROUP BY 
    i.i_brand, 
    i.i_brand_id,
    t.t_hour,
    t.t_minute 
ORDER BY 
    ext_price DESC, 
    i.i_brand_id;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replaced comma-separated table lists in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs.
- **Explicit Join Conditions**: Moved join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the JOINs.
- **Filter Conditions**: Kept the WHERE clause only for non-join conditions.
- **Union and Subquery Joins**: Ensured that each subquery within the UNION ALL is explicitly joining with the `date_dim` table, and conditions specific to each sales table are moved into the respective JOIN clauses.

These changes should make the query more readable and maintainable, and could potentially improve execution by allowing the database engine to better optimize the execution plan.
