To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select  * 
from (
    select i_manufact_id, sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales, avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manufact_id) avg_quarterly_sales 
    from item, store_sales, date_dim, store 
    where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
      and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
      and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk 
      and d_month_seq in (1186,1187,1188,1189,1190,1191,1192,1193,1194,1195,1196,1197)
      and (
          (i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics') 
           and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help') 
           and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7', 'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9')) 
          or
          (i_category in ('Women','Music','Men') 
           and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants') 
           and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1', 'importoamalg #1'))
      ) 
    group by i_manufact_id, d_qoy 
) tmp1 
where case when avg_quarterly_sales > 0 then abs(sum_sales - avg_quarterly_sales)/ avg_quarterly_sales else null end > 0.1 
order by avg_quarterly_sales, sum_sales, i_manufact_id 
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (
    SELECT i_manufact_id, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manufact_id) AS avg_quarterly_sales 
    FROM item
    JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq IN (1186,1187,1188,1189,1190,1191,1192,1193,1194,1195,1196,1197)
      AND (
          (i_category IN ('Books','Children','Electronics') 
           AND i_class IN ('personal','portable','reference','self-help') 
           AND i_brand IN ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7', 'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9')) 
          OR
          (i_category IN ('Women','Music','Men') 
           AND i_class IN ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants') 
           AND i_brand IN ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1', 'importoamalg #1'))
      ) 
    GROUP BY i_manufact_id, d_qoy 
) AS tmp1 
WHERE CASE WHEN avg_quarterly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_quarterly_sales) / avg_quarterly_sales ELSE NULL END > 0.1 
ORDER BY avg_quarterly_sales, sum_sales, i_manufact_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses of the JOINs.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that are specific to the relationships between the tables are moved to the ON clauses, while filters that pertain to specific table attributes remain in the WHERE clause.
- This restructuring improves readability and potentially allows the query optimizer to better understand the relationships and filter data earlier in the query process, potentially improving performance.
