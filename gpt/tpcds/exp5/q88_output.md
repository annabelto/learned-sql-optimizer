To optimize the given query, I will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query

This optimized query uses explicit JOIN syntax and moves conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause where appropriate, making the query more readable and potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to optimize join operations more effectively.
