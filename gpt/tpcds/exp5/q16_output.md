To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules in the specified order:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select count(distinct cs_order_number) as "order count",
       sum(cs_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost",
       sum(cs_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from catalog_sales cs1, date_dim, customer_address, call_center
where d_date between '2002-4-01' and (cast('2002-4-01' as date) + 60)
  and cs1.cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
  and cs1.cs_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  and ca_state = 'PA'
  and cs1.cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
  and cc_county in ('Williamson County', 'Williamson County', 'Williamson County', 'Williamson County', 'Williamson County')
  and exists (
      select * from catalog_sales cs2
      where cs1.cs_order_number = cs2.cs_order_number
        and cs1.cs_warehouse_sk <> cs2.cs_warehouse_sk
  )
  and not exists(
      select * from catalog_returns cr1
      where cs1.cs_order_number = cr1.cr_order_number
  )
order by count(distinct cs_order_number)
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cs1.cs_order_number) AS "order count",
       SUM(cs1.cs_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
       SUM(cs1.cs_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM catalog_sales cs1
JOIN date_dim ON cs1.cs_ship_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
JOIN customer_address ON cs1.cs_ship_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN call_center ON cs1.cs_call_center_sk = call_center.cc_call_center_sk
WHERE date_dim.d_date BETWEEN '2002-4-01' AND (CAST('2002-4-01' AS DATE) + 60)
  AND customer_address.ca_state = 'PA'
  AND call_center.cc_county IN ('Williamson County')
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT * FROM catalog_sales cs2
      WHERE cs1.cs_order_number = cs2.cs_order_number
        AND cs1.cs_warehouse_sk <> cs2.cs_warehouse_sk
  )
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT * FROM catalog_returns cr1
      WHERE cs1.cs_order_number = cr1.cr_order_number
  )
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT cs1.cs_order_number)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax, specifying the join conditions using the ON clause. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the conditions that were logically part of the join (e.g., linking foreign keys) from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses of the joins.
- **Optimization:** The use of explicit JOINs and moving conditions to the ON clause can help the query optimizer better understand the relationships between tables, potentially leading to more efficient execution plans.
