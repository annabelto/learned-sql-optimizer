To optimize the provided PostgreSQL query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Application of Rules:

1. **Replace comma-separated tables with explicit JOIN syntax**: This improves readability and explicitly defines the relationship between tables.
2. **Convert implicit joins in the WHERE clause to explicit JOIN conditions**: This clarifies the join conditions and can help the query optimizer.
3. **Move relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause in JOINs**: This can potentially allow the optimizer to reduce the dataset earlier in the execution plan.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_moy, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name
        ) AS avg_monthly_sales
    FROM 
        item
        JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001
        AND (
            (i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('history', 'school-uniforms', 'audio'))
            OR (i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Shoes') AND i_class IN ('pants', 'tennis', 'womens'))
        )
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, 
        i_class, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_moy
) AS tmp1
WHERE 
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_monthly_sales <> 0 THEN (ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales)
        ELSE NULL 
    END > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:

- **Explicit JOINs**: The query now uses explicit `JOIN` syntax with conditions specified in the `ON` clause, making the relationships between tables clear.
- **Conditions Moved**: Conditions related to the year and categories/classes are kept in the `WHERE` clause as they are not directly part of the join logic but are filters applied post-join.
- **Window Function**: The window function remains unchanged as it is used for calculating averages over partitions defined by category, brand, and store details.
- **Filtering and Ordering**: The final filtering on the calculated average and the ordering remain unchanged, as they are applied after the main query execution.

This optimized query should be more readable and potentially offer better performance by allowing the database engine to optimize join operations and data filtering more effectively.
