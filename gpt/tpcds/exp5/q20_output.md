To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(cs_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_category IN ('Books', 'Music', 'Sports')
    AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-06-18' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-06-18' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30 days')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and specified the join conditions using the ON keyword. This clarifies how the tables are related and ensures that the joins are correctly understood by both the reader and the database engine.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the conditions that relate to how the tables are joined from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs. This can help the database optimizer by potentially reducing the number of rows to be joined.
- **Date Interval:** Updated the date addition to use the `INTERVAL` syntax for clarity and correctness in PostgreSQL.

These changes make the query more readable and can help in achieving better performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the join operations more effectively.
