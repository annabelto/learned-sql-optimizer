I apologize for the repeated errors in my previous attempts. Let's ensure the optimized query maintains the exact logical structure and output as the original query, while applying the specified rewrite rules correctly.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ss AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON ss.ss_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    WHERE i.i_category = 'Books' AND d.d_year = 2001 AND d.d_moy = 3 AND ca.ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
), cs AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, SUM(cs.cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM catalog_sales cs
    JOIN item i ON cs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON cs.cs_bill_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    WHERE i.i_category = 'Books' AND d.d_year = 2001 AND d.d_moy = 3 AND ca.ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
), ws AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, SUM(ws.ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
    FROM web_sales ws
    JOIN item i ON ws.ws_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim d ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ca ON ws.ws_bill_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    WHERE i.i_category = 'Books' AND d.d_year = 2001 AND d.d_moy = 3 AND ca.ca_gmt_offset = -5
    GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
)
SELECT i_manufact_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM ss
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM cs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM ws
) tmp1
GROUP BY i_manufact_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: I have used explicit JOINs instead of comma-separated tables.
- **Explicit Join Conditions**: I moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the JOINs where applicable.
- **Filtering Conditions**: I ensured that the filtering conditions are correctly placed to match the logic of the original query.
- **Maintaining Logical Equivalence**: The WHERE clause conditions now correctly reflect the original query's intent, specifically filtering by `i.i_category = 'Books'` directly in the WHERE clause.

This revised query should now correctly reflect the logic of the original query while using optimized SQL practices.
