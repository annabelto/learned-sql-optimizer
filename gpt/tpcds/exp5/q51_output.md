To optimize the given query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH web_v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        ws_item_sk AS item_sk, 
        d_date, 
        SUM(SUM(ws_sales_price)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY ws_item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS cume_sales 
    FROM 
        web_sales 
        JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1212 AND 1212 + 11 
        AND ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL 
    GROUP BY 
        ws_item_sk, d_date
), 
store_v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        ss_item_sk AS item_sk, 
        d_date, 
        SUM(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY ss_item_sk

            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS cume_sales 
    FROM 
        store_sales 
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1212 AND 1212 + 11 
        AND ss_item_sk IS NOT NULL 
    GROUP BY 
        ss_item_sk, d_date

SELECT 
    * 
FROM (
    SELECT 
        item_sk,
        d_date,
        web_sales,
        store_sales,
        MAX(web_sales) OVER (
            PARTITION BY item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS web_cumulative,
        MAX(store_sales) OVER (
            PARTITION BY item_sk 
            ORDER BY d_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS store_cumulative
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) AS item_sk,
            COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) AS d_date,
            web.cume_sales AS web_sales,
            store.cume_sales AS store_sales
        FROM 
            web_v1 web 
            FULL OUTER JOIN store_v1 store 
            ON web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date
    ) x
) y
WHERE 
    web_cumulative > store_cumulative 
ORDER BY 
    item_sk, 
    d_date 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table joins in the `web_v1` and `store_v1` subqueries with explicit `JOIN` syntax and moved the join conditions to the `ON` clause.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that were part of the `WHERE` clause and directly related to the join have been moved to the `ON` clause in the `JOIN` operations.
- **General Optimization:** I used `COALESCE` in the final SELECT to simplify the `CASE` statements for `item_sk` and `d_date`, which makes the query slightly more readable and concise.

These changes should help in improving the readability and potentially the performance of the query by making better use of indexes and join optimizations in PostgreSQL.
