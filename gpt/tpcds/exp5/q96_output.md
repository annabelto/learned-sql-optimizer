To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM store_sales
JOIN time_dim ON ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk
JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
WHERE time_dim.t_hour = 8
  AND time_dim.t_minute >= 30
  AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 0
  AND store.s_store_name = 'ese'
ORDER BY COUNT(*)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Explicit Join Syntax**: I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions**: I moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOIN statements.
3. **Filter Conditions**: Conditions that are not part of the join logic but are filters on specific tables (like `time_dim.t_hour = 8`, `time_dim.t_minute >= 30`, `household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 0`, and `store.s_store_name = 'ese'`) remain in the WHERE clause.

This restructuring makes the query easier to read and understand, and it can help the database optimizer to create a more efficient execution plan.
