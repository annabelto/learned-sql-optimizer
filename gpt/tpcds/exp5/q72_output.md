To optimize the given TPC-DS query, we will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

The provided query already uses explicit join syntax and does not use comma-separated tables in the FROM clause, so rules 1 and 2 are not applicable here. The query also already uses explicit join conditions (rule 5). However, we can apply rules 3, 4, and 6 to further optimize the query by moving some conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_desc,
    w_warehouse_name,
    d1.d_week_seq,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo,
    COUNT(*) AS total_cnt
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    inventory ON (cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk AND inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity)
JOIN 
    warehouse ON (w_warehouse_sk = inv_warehouse_sk)
JOIN 
    item ON (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON (cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cd_marital_status = 'S')
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON (cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk AND hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000')
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON (cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk AND d1.d_year = 1998)
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON (inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq)
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON (cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5)
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    promotion ON (cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk)
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    catalog_returns ON (cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND cr_order_number = cs_order_number)
GROUP BY 
    i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq
ORDER BY 
    total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**
- Conditions related to `inventory`, `customer_demographics`, `household_demographics`, and `date_dim` tables have been moved from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses of the JOINs. This can potentially improve the performance by reducing the number of rows joined and processed in later stages of the query execution.
- The query now explicitly handles all join conditions and filters early in the join process, which is generally more efficient in terms of query execution planning and optimization.
