To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ss_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_category IN ('Men', 'Sports', 'Jewelry')
    AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-02-05' AS DATE) AND (CAST('1999-02-05' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30 days')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Explicit Join Syntax**: I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions**: I moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses of the JOINs.
3. **Filter Conditions**: Conditions that are not join conditions remain in the WHERE clause.
4. **Date Interval**: Updated the date interval syntax to use `INTERVAL '30 days'` for clarity and correctness.

These changes make the query more readable and maintainable, and they can potentially help the database optimizer to create a more efficient execution plan.
