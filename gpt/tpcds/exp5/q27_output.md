To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules in the specified order:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) g_state, avg(ss_quantity) agg1, avg(ss_list_price) agg2, avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3, avg(ss_sales_price) agg4 
from store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, store, item 
where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
  and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
  and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk 
  and ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk 
  and cd_gender = 'M' 
  and cd_marital_status = 'W' 
  and cd_education_status = 'Secondary' 
  and d_year = 1999 
  and s_state in ('TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN', 'TN') 
group by rollup (i_item_id, s_state) 
order by i_item_id, s_state 
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) AS g_state, 
       AVG(ss_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(ss_list_price) AS agg2, 
       AVG(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(ss_sales_price) AS agg4
FROM store_sales
JOIN customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE cd_gender = 'M' 
  AND cd_marital_status = 'W' 
  AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary' 
  AND d_year = 1999 
  AND s_state = 'TN' -- Simplified repeated 'TN' values to a single 'TN'
GROUP BY ROLLUP (i_item_id, s_state)
ORDER BY i_item_id, s_state
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses of the JOINs. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that are directly related to the join logic are moved to the ON clause. This can potentially improve performance as the join conditions are evaluated earlier in the query execution.
- **Simplification:** The list of states in the WHERE clause was simplified to a single 'TN' since all values were the same, which makes the query cleaner and potentially avoids unnecessary processing of duplicate conditions.
