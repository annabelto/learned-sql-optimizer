To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules in the specified order:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql

    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status,

    count(*) AS cnt1,

    cd_credit_rating, 
    count(*) AS cnt3

    customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk

WHERE 
    ca.ca_state IN ('IL', 'TX', 'ME')
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT * 
        FROM 
            store_sales ss
        JOIN 
            date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
        WHERE 
            c.c_customer_sk = ss.ss_customer_sk 
            AND d.d_year = 2002 
            AND d.d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 3
    )

```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit Join Syntax:** Replaced comma-separated table listing in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
- **Explicit Join Conditions:** Moved join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs.
- **Subquery Joins:** In the EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries, I replaced implicit joins with explicit JOINs and moved the join conditions to the ON clause.
- **Filter Conditions:** Kept the state filter and date filters in the WHERE clause as they are not directly related to joining tables but are filtering records based on specific criteria.

These changes improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query by clearly defining join conditions and separating filtering logic.
