To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:

```sql

    ca_state, 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_dep_count, 
    COUNT(*) AS cnt1,

    SUM(cd_dep_count),

    COUNT(*) AS cnt3,

    STDDEV_SAMP(cd_dep_college_count), 
    SUM(cd_dep_college_count)

            AND d.d_year = 1999 
            AND d.d_qoy < 4
    )
    AND (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT * 
            FROM 
                web_sales ws

                AND d.d_year = 1999 
                AND d.d_qoy < 4
        )
        OR EXISTS (
            SELECT * 
            FROM 
                catalog_sales cs
            JOIN 
                date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
            WHERE 
                c.c_customer_sk = cs.cs_ship_customer_sk

                AND d.d_qoy < 4
        )
    )
GROUP BY 
    ca_state, 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_dep_count, 
    cd_dep_employed_count, 
    cd_dep_college_count 
ORDER BY 
    ca_state, 
    cd_gender, 
    cd_marital_status, 
    cd_dep_count, 
    cd_dep_employed_count, 
    cd_dep_college_count 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that logically belong to specific joins are moved to the ON clauses of those joins, which can help the database optimizer to apply more efficient execution plans by reducing the dataset early in the execution process.
