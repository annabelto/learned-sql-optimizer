To optimize the provided query, I will apply the rules listed in the prompt to transform the query into one that uses explicit JOIN syntax and moves conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause in JOINs. This will make the query more readable and potentially allow the database engine to optimize the execution plan more effectively.

### Rules Applied:
1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name,
    MAX(ss_net_profit) AS store_sales_profit,
    MAX(sr_net_loss) AS store_returns_loss,
    MAX(cs_net_profit) AS catalog_sales_profit
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk
                   AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
                   AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
JOIN 
    catalog_sales ON sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk
                   AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d3 ON cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
WHERE 
    d1.d_moy = 4 
    AND d1.d_year = 1999
    AND d2.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10
    AND d2.d_year = 1999
    AND d3.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10
    AND d3.d_year = 1999
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
ORDER BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    s_store_id,
    s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit JOINs**: All tables are joined using explicit JOIN syntax, which clearly defines how tables are related.
- **Conditions Moved to ON Clauses**: Conditions that define the relationships between tables are moved to the ON clauses of the corresponding JOINs.
- **Filter Conditions in WHERE Clause**: Only the filter conditions that do not define table relationships are left in the WHERE clause.
- **Readability and Maintenance**: The query is now easier to read and maintain, as the relationships and filters are clearly separated. This also helps in understanding the data flow and dependencies among tables.
