Apologies for the oversight. It appears there was a mistake in referencing a column that does not exist in the provided schema context. Let's correct the join condition by ensuring we use the correct column names and relationships as per the schema.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
    SELECT 
        cr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
        ca_state AS ctr_state,
        SUM(cr_return_amt_inc_tax) AS ctr_total_return
    FROM 
        catalog_returns
        JOIN date_dim ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN customer_address ON cr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2001
    GROUP BY 
        cr_returning_customer_sk,
        ca_state
)
SELECT 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    ca_street_number,
    ca_street_name,
    ca_street_type,
    ca_suite_number,
    ca_city,
    ca_county,
    ca_state,
    ca_zip,
    ca_country,
    ca_gmt_offset,
    ca_location_type,
    ctr_total_return
FROM 
    customer_total_return ctr1
    JOIN customer ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk AND ca_state = 'TN'
WHERE 
    ctr_total_return > (
        SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
        FROM customer_total_return ctr2
        WHERE ctr1.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state
    )
ORDER BY 
    c_customer_id,
    c_salutation,
    c_first_name,
    c_last_name,
    ca_street_number,
    ca_street_name,
    ca_street_type,
    ca_suite_number,
    ca_city,
    ca_county,
    ca_state,
    ca_zip,
    ca_country,
    ca_gmt_offset,
    ca_location_type,
    ctr_total_return
LIMIT 100;
```

### Corrections Made:
- **Corrected Join Condition:** Fixed the join condition between `customer` and `customer_address` by correctly referencing `c_current_addr_sk` in the `JOIN` clause.
- **Order of Joins:** Adjusted the order of joins to ensure logical sequence and correctness based on the schema relationships.

This revised query should now execute without errors, assuming the schema provided in the initial query context is correct. The join conditions and table relationships are now properly aligned with typical schema expectations.
