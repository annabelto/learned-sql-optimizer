To optimize the provided PostgreSQL query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules in the specified order:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select  * from (
    select i_manager_id, sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales, avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales 
    from item, store_sales, date_dim, store 
    where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk 
        and d_month_seq in (1222,1223,1224,1225,1226,1227,1228,1229,1230,1231,1232,1233) 
        and (
            (
                i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics') 
                and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help') 
                and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7', 'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9')
            ) or (
                i_category in ('Women','Music','Men') 
                and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants') 
                and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1', 'importoamalg #1')
            )
        ) 
    group by i_manager_id, d_moy
) tmp1 
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1 
order by i_manager_id, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales 
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (
    SELECT i_manager_id, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) AS avg_monthly_sales 
    FROM item
    JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq IN (1222,1223,1224,1225,1226,1227,1228,1229,1230,1231,1232,1233) 
        AND (
            (
                i_category IN ('Books','Children','Electronics') 
                AND i_class IN ('personal','portable','reference','self-help') 
                AND i_brand IN ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7', 'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9')
            ) OR (
                i_category IN ('Women','Music','Men') 
                AND i_class IN ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants') 
                AND i_brand IN ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1', 'importoamalg #1')
            )
        ) 
    GROUP BY i_manager_id, d_moy
) AS tmp1 
WHERE CASE WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales ELSE NULL END > 0.1 
ORDER BY i_manager_id, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses of the JOINs.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that are directly related to the join logic are moved to the ON clause to clarify the relationship between tables and potentially improve the performance by reducing the number of rows earlier in the query processing.
- The query now uses explicit JOINs which are generally preferred for clarity and potentially better performance as the optimizer understands the intent more clearly.
