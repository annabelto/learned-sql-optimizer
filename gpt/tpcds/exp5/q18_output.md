To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id, 
    ca_country, 
    ca_state, 
    ca_county, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_quantity AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg1, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_list_price AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg2, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_coupon_amt AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg3, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_sales_price AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg4, 
    AVG(CAST(cs_net_profit AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg5, 
    AVG(CAST(c_birth_year AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg6, 
    AVG(CAST(cd1.cd_dep_count AS DECIMAL(12,2))) AS agg7
FROM 
    catalog_sales
JOIN 
    item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd1 ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd1.cd_demo_sk AND cd1.cd_gender = 'F' AND cd1.cd_education_status = 'Primary'
JOIN 
    customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk AND c_birth_month IN (1,3,7,11,10,4)
JOIN 
    customer_demographics cd2 ON c_current_cdemo_sk = cd2.cd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk AND ca_state IN ('AL','MO','TN','GA','MT','IN','CA')
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county)
ORDER BY 
    ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Explicit Join Syntax**: I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions**: Each JOIN now explicitly states the condition under which the tables are linked.
3. **Moving Conditions to ON Clauses**: Conditions related to the join (e.g., `cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`) are moved to the ON clause of the respective JOIN. This includes filters that are logically part of the join condition, such as `d_year = 2001` for the `date_dim` table, which directly relates to the join key.
4. **Filter Conditions in ON Clauses**: For better performance and clarity, conditions that are directly related to the demographics and addresses (like `cd1.cd_gender = 'F'`) are moved to the respective ON clauses.

This restructuring should help in improving the readability and potentially the performance of the query by allowing the database engine to better optimize the execution plan, especially in how it handles joins and filters.
