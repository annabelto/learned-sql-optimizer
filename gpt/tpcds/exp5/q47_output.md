To optimize the given TPC-DS query, I will apply the provided data-independent rewrite rules in a logical sequence to improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query. The rules I will use are:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
WITH v1 AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_moy, 
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales,
        AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_year) AS avg_monthly_sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name ORDER BY d_year, d_moy) AS rn
    FROM 
        item
        JOIN store_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d_year = 2000 OR 
        (d_year = 1999 AND d_moy = 12) OR 
        (d_year = 2001 AND d_moy = 1)
    GROUP BY 
        i_category, 
        i_brand, 
        s_store_name, 
        s_company_name, 
        d_year, 
        d_moy
), 
v2 AS (
    SELECT 
        v1.s_store_name, 
        v1.s_company_name,
        v1.d_year,
        v1.avg_monthly_sales,
        v1.sum_sales,
        v1_lag.sum_sales AS psum,
        v1_lead.sum_sales AS nsum
    FROM 
        v1
        JOIN v1 AS v1_lag ON v1.i_category = v1_lag.i_category 
            AND v1.i_brand = v1_lag.i_brand 
            AND v1.s_store_name = v1_lag.s_store_name 
            AND v1.s_company_name = v1_lag.s_company_name 
            AND v1.rn = v1_lag.rn + 1
        JOIN v1 AS v1_lead ON v1.i_category = v1_lead.i_category 
            AND v1.i_brand = v1_lead.i_brand 
            AND v1.s_store_name = v1_lead.s_store_name 
            AND v1.s_company_name = v1_lead.s_company_name 
            AND v1.rn = v1_lead.rn - 1
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    v2
WHERE 
    d_year = 2000 AND 
    avg_monthly_sales > 0 AND 
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales 
        ELSE NULL 
    END > 0.1
ORDER BY 
    sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, 
    nsum
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table joins with explicit `JOIN` syntax and moved the join conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of each join. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that were part of the logical linking of tables were moved from the `WHERE` clause to the respective `ON` clauses in the joins. This can help in improving the performance as the join conditions are evaluated earlier in the query execution plan.

These changes should make the query more maintainable and potentially improve execution by clarifying the join conditions and scopes.
