To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
from item, inventory, date_dim, catalog_sales 
where i_current_price between 29 and 29 + 30 
  and inv_item_sk = i_item_sk 
  and d_date_sk = inv_date_sk 
  and d_date between cast('2002-03-29' as date) and (cast('2002-03-29' as date) + 60) 
  and i_manufact_id in (705,742,777,944) 
  and inv_quantity_on_hand between 100 and 500 
  and cs_item_sk = i_item_sk 
group by i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
order by i_item_id 
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price 
FROM item
JOIN inventory ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk
JOIN catalog_sales ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 29 AND 59
  AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-03-29' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-03-29' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 days')
  AND i_manufact_id IN (705, 742, 777, 944)
  AND inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
ORDER BY i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs, specifying the join conditions using the ON keyword. This makes the query easier to read and understand.
- **Rule 6:** I moved conditions that were part of the WHERE clause and directly related to the join conditions into the ON clauses of the respective JOINs. This can help the query planner optimize the joins more effectively.
- I also simplified the date arithmetic to use the INTERVAL keyword for clarity and correctness.

These changes should make the query more efficient and easier to maintain.
