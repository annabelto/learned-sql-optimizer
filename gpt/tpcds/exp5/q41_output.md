To optimize the provided query, we will apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query by using explicit join syntax and moving conditions appropriately. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause**: This rule is not directly applicable here as there is no comma-separated table list in the FROM clause.
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins**: This rule is also not directly applicable as there are no implicit joins.
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables**: This rule is applicable as we can convert the subquery to a JOIN for better clarity and potentially better performance.
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables**: Similar to the above, we will use JOIN to combine tables.
5. **Use explicit join conditions**: We will ensure that all join conditions are explicitly stated in the ON clause of the JOIN.
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs**: We will move relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause to make the join conditions explicit and potentially allow the optimizer to perform better.

This optimized query uses explicit JOIN syntax and moves conditions to the appropriate places, improving clarity and potentially allowing the database engine to optimize execution.
