To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price)
FROM 
    date_dim dt
JOIN 
    store_sales ON dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    item ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
WHERE 
    item.i_manager_id = 1 
    AND dt.d_moy = 11 
    AND dt.d_year = 1998
GROUP BY 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category
ORDER BY 
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) DESC,
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_category_id,
    item.i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and specified the join conditions using the ON keyword. This clarifies how the tables are related and ensures that the joins are correctly represented.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the conditions related to the specific columns of the tables involved in the joins (e.g., `dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk` and `store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk`) from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses of the JOINs. This helps in potentially reducing the dataset early during the join process rather than filtering after a larger dataset has been created, which can improve performance.

These changes make the query more readable and potentially improve its execution performance by making better use of indexes and reducing the size of intermediate results.
