To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Application of Rules:

1. **Convert comma-separated table list to explicit JOIN syntax**: This makes the query easier to read and understand, especially when dealing with multiple tables.
2. **Replace implicit joins (conditions in WHERE clause) with explicit JOIN conditions**: This involves moving join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clause of each JOIN.
3. **Move non-join conditions to a WHERE clause**: This separates the join logic from the filtering logic, which can help in understanding and potentially optimizing the query by the query planner.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT SUM(ss_quantity)
FROM store_sales
JOIN store ON store.s_store_sk = store_sales.ss_store_sk
JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk AND date_dim.d_year = 2001
JOIN customer_demographics ON store_sales.ss_cdemo_sk = customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk
JOIN customer_address ON store_sales.ss_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk AND customer_address.ca_country = 'United States'
WHERE 
    (
        (customer_demographics.cd_marital_status = 'S' AND customer_demographics.cd_education_status = 'Secondary' AND store_sales.ss_sales_price BETWEEN 100.00 AND 150.00)
        OR (customer_demographics.cd_marital_status = 'M' AND customer_demographics.cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree' AND store_sales.ss_sales_price BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00)
        OR (customer_demographics.cd_marital_status = 'D' AND customer_demographics.cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree' AND store_sales.ss_sales_price BETWEEN 150.00 AND 200.00)
    )
    AND (
        (customer_address.ca_state IN ('ND', 'NY', 'SD') AND store_sales.ss_net_profit BETWEEN 0 AND 2000)
        OR (customer_address.ca_state IN ('MD', 'GA', 'KS') AND store_sales.ss_net_profit BETWEEN 150 AND 3000)
        OR (customer_address.ca_state IN ('CO', 'MN', 'NC') AND store_sales.ss_net_profit BETWEEN 50 AND 25000)
    );
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit JOINs** are used to clearly define how tables are connected.
- **Conditions on specific columns** (like `d_year`, `ca_country`) are moved to the respective JOIN clauses where possible to limit the rows joined.
- **Filter conditions** that do not directly relate to how the tables are joined remain in the WHERE clause, focusing on filtering the result set after the necessary rows have been joined.
- This structure helps in potentially utilizing indexes effectively (if available) and makes the query execution plan more efficient by reducing the number of rows processed in the joins before applying filters.
