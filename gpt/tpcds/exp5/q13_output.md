To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(ss_quantity),
    AVG(ss_ext_sales_price),
    AVG(ss_ext_wholesale_cost),
    SUM(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = ss_cdemo_sk
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk AND ca_country = 'United States'
WHERE 
    (
        (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'College' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 100.00 AND 150.00 AND hd_dep_count = 3)
        OR (cd_marital_status = 'D' AND cd_education_status = 'Primary' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00 AND hd_dep_count = 1)
        OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree' AND ss_sales_price BETWEEN 150.00 AND 200.00 AND hd_dep_count = 1)
    )
    AND (
        (ca_state IN ('IL', 'TN', 'TX') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 100 AND 200)
        OR (ca_state IN ('WY', 'OH', 'ID') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 150 AND 300)
        OR (ca_state IN ('MS', 'SC', 'IA') AND ss_net_profit BETWEEN 50 AND 250)
    );
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs, specifying the join conditions using the ON keyword. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** I moved conditions that are directly related to the join (like `s_store_sk = ss_store_sk`) into the ON clause of the corresponding JOIN. Conditions that filter the result set based on attributes of multiple tables remain in the WHERE clause.

This rewritten query should be functionally equivalent to the original but is structured in a way that is clearer and potentially allows the database engine to optimize the execution plan more effectively.
