To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    item.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg
FROM 
    date_dim AS dt
JOIN 
    store_sales AS ss
    ON dt.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    item
    ON ss.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
WHERE 
    item.i_manufact_id = 816
    AND dt.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY 
    dt.d_year,
    item.i_brand,
    item.i_brand_id
ORDER BY 
    dt.d_year,
    sum_agg DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Explicit Join Syntax**: I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions**: I moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs. This makes the query easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Filter Conditions**: Conditions that are not part of the join logic (i.e., `item.i_manufact_id = 816` and `dt.d_moy = 11`) remain in the WHERE clause. This separation clarifies that these conditions are filters applied after the joins have been computed.

These changes make the query more readable and maintainable, and they adhere to modern SQL practices. Additionally, by using explicit JOIN syntax and conditions, the database engine can optimize the execution plan more effectively.
