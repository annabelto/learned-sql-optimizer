To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    ca_city,
    bought_city,
    ss_ticket_number,
    amt,
    profit
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            ss_ticket_number,
            ss_customer_sk,
            ca_city AS bought_city,
            SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
            SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit
        FROM 
            store_sales
            JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
            JOIN store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
            JOIN household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
            JOIN customer_address ON store_sales.ss_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
        WHERE 
            (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 8 OR household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count = 0)
            AND date_dim.d_dow IN (6, 0)
            AND date_dim.d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
            AND store.s_city IN ('Midway', 'Fairview')
        GROUP BY 
            ss_ticket_number,
            ss_customer_sk,
            ss_addr_sk,
            ca_city
    ) AS dn
    JOIN customer ON dn.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    JOIN customer_address AS current_addr ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = current_addr.ca_address_sk
WHERE 
    current_addr.ca_city <> bought_city
ORDER BY 
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    ca_city,
    bought_city,
    ss_ticket_number
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Explicit Join Syntax:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions:** I moved the conditions that link tables from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs. This includes conditions linking `store_sales` with `date_dim`, `store`, `household_demographics`, and `customer_address`.
3. **Grouping and Filtering:** I retained the grouping and filtering conditions within the subquery to ensure the logic of the query remains consistent.
4. **Final Join and Filtering:** In the outer query, I used explicit JOINs to link `dn` with `customer` and `customer_address` (aliased as `current_addr`). The condition checking for different cities is kept in the WHERE clause of the outer query.

This optimized query should be more readable and potentially offer better performance due to clearer separation of join conditions and filtering logic.
