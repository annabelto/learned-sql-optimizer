To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules in the specified order:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select ca_zip, sum(cs_sales_price)
from catalog_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim
where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  and (substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
       or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
       or cs_sales_price > 500)
  and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  and d_qoy = 2
  and d_year = 2001
group by ca_zip
order by ca_zip
limit 100;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE (substr(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
       OR ca_state IN ('CA', 'WA', 'GA')
       OR cs_sales_price > 500)
  AND d_qoy = 2
  AND d_year = 2001
GROUP BY ca_zip
ORDER BY ca_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and specified the join conditions using the ON keyword. This clarifies how the tables are related and ensures that the joins are correctly understood by the database engine.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the join-related conditions from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses in the JOINs. This helps in potentially reducing the dataset earlier during query execution, as the join conditions are applied while the join is being processed.

These changes should help in improving the readability and potentially the performance of the query by making better use of indexes and reducing the amount of data processed in later stages of the query execution.
