To optimize the provided PostgreSQL query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Application of Rules:

1. **Convert comma-separated table list to explicit JOIN syntax**: This involves replacing the commas in the FROM clause with JOIN keywords and specifying the type of join.
2. **Move join-related conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause**: This involves taking conditions that link tables together from the WHERE clause and moving them to appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs.
3. **Use explicit join conditions**: Ensure that each JOIN clearly states the condition under which the tables are joined.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    substr(w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm_type,
    web_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws_ship_date_sk - ws_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws_ship_date_sk - ws_sold_date_sk > 30) AND (ws_ship_date_sk - ws_sold_date_sk <= 60) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws_ship_date_sk - ws_sold_date_sk > 60) AND (ws_ship_date_sk - ws_sold_date_sk <= 90) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws_ship_date_sk - ws_sold_date_sk > 90) AND (ws_ship_date_sk - ws_sold_date_sk <= 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (ws_ship_date_sk - ws_sold_date_sk > 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM 
    web_sales
JOIN 
    warehouse ON ws_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
JOIN 
    ship_mode ON ws_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk
JOIN 
    web_site ON ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    d_month_seq BETWEEN 1223 AND 1223 + 11
GROUP BY 
    substr(w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm_type,
    web_name
ORDER BY 
    substr(w_warehouse_name, 1, 20),
    sm_type,
    web_name
LIMIT 100;
```

This optimized query uses explicit JOIN syntax with conditions moved to the ON clauses, making the query easier to read and potentially allowing the database engine to optimize the execution plan more effectively.
