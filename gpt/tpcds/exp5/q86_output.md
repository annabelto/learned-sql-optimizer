To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select * from (
    select sum(ws_net_paid) as total_sum,
           i_category,
           i_class,
           grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy,
           rank() over (
               partition by grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class),
               case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end
               order by sum(ws_net_paid) desc
           ) as rank_within_parent
    from web_sales, date_dim d1, item
    where d1.d_month_seq between 1186 and 1186 + 11
      and d1.d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
      and i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
    group by rollup(i_category, i_class)
) as sub
order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent
limit 100;
```

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Replace comma-separated tables with explicit JOIN syntax**:
   Replace `from web_sales, date_dim d1, item` with explicit JOINs.

2. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables**:
   Convert conditions in the WHERE clause that link tables into JOIN conditions.

3. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs**:
   Move the conditions `d1.d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk` and `i_item_sk = ws_item_sk` from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
select * from (
    select sum(ws_net_paid) as total_sum,
           i_category,
           i_class,
           grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy,
           rank() over (
               partition by grouping(i_category) + grouping(i_class),
               case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end
               order by sum(ws_net_paid) desc
           ) as rank_within_parent
    from web_sales
    join date_dim d1 on d1.d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
    join item on i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
    where d1.d_month_seq between 1186 and 1186 + 11
    group by rollup(i_category, i_class)
) as sub
order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent
limit 100;
```

This rewritten query uses explicit JOIN syntax and moves conditions to the ON clause, making it clearer and potentially allowing the database engine to optimize the execution plan more effectively.
