To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS total_sum,
        s_state,
        s_county,
        grouping(s_state) + grouping(s_county) AS lochierarchy,
        rank() OVER (
            PARTITION BY grouping(s_state) + grouping(s_county), 
            CASE WHEN grouping(s_county) = 0 THEN s_state END 
            ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) DESC
        ) AS rank_within_parent
    FROM 
        store_sales
        JOIN date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
        JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
    WHERE 
        d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231
        AND s_state IN (
            SELECT s_state
            FROM (
                SELECT 
                    s_state,
                    rank() OVER (
                        PARTITION BY s_state 
                        ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) DESC
                    ) AS ranking
                FROM 
                    store_sales
                    JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
                    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
                WHERE 
                    d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231
                GROUP BY s_state
            ) tmp1
            WHERE ranking <= 5
        )
    GROUP BY ROLLUP(s_state, s_county)
) AS sub
ORDER BY 
    lochierarchy DESC,
    CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN s_state END,
    rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Explicit Join Syntax**: Replaced comma-separated table listing in the `FROM` clause with explicit `JOIN` clauses.
2. **Explicit Join Conditions**: Moved join conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the respective `JOIN` statements.
3. **Filtering Conditions**: Kept filtering conditions (like `d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1220 AND 1231`) in the `WHERE` clause, as they do not relate directly to how the tables are joined but rather filter the rows after joining.
4. **Subquery Joins**: Applied the same principles to the subquery that determines which states to include based on their ranking.

These changes should make the query more readable and maintainable, and potentially allow the database engine to optimize the execution plan more effectively.
