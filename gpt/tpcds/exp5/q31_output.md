To optimize the given query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ss AS (
    SELECT ca_county, d_qoy, d_year, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS store_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    GROUP BY ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
),
ws AS (
    SELECT ca_county, d_qoy, d_year, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS web_sales
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    GROUP BY ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
)
SELECT 
    ss1.ca_county,
    ss1.d_year,
    ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales AS web_q1_q2_increase,
    ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales AS store_q1_q2_increase,
    ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales AS web_q2_q3_increase,
    ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales AS store_q2_q3_increase
FROM 
    ss AS ss1
    JOIN ss AS ss2 ON ss1.ca_county = ss2.ca_county AND ss1.d_year = ss2.d_year
    JOIN ss AS ss3 ON ss2.ca_county = ss3.ca_county AND ss2.d_year = ss3.d_year
    JOIN ws AS ws1 ON ss1.ca_county = ws1.ca_county AND ss1.d_year = ws1.d_year
    JOIN ws AS ws2 ON ws1.ca_county = ws2.ca_county AND ws1.d_year = ws2.d_year
    JOIN ws AS ws3 ON ws2.ca_county = ws3.ca_county AND ws2.d_year = ws3.d_year
WHERE 
    ss1.d_qoy = 1 AND ss2.d_qoy = 2 AND ss3.d_qoy = 3 AND
    ws1.d_qoy = 1 AND ws2.d_qoy = 2 AND ws3.d_qoy = 3 AND
    ss1.d_year = 1999 AND ss2.d_year = 1999 AND ss3.d_year = 1999 AND
    ws1.d_year = 1999 AND ws2.d_year = 1999 AND ws3.d_year = 1999 AND
    CASE WHEN ws1.web_sales > 0 THEN ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales ELSE NULL END > 
    CASE WHEN ss1.store_sales > 0 THEN ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales ELSE NULL END AND
    CASE WHEN ws2.web_sales > 0 THEN ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales ELSE NULL END > 
    CASE WHEN ss2.store_sales > 0 THEN ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales ELSE NULL END
ORDER BY 
    store_q2_q3_increase;
```

### Explanation

- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that logically belong to specific joins are moved to the ON clauses, which can help the database optimizer to apply filters earlier in the execution plan, potentially improving performance.
