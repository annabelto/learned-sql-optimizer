To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules in the specified order:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, 
    i.i_brand AS brand, 
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price 
FROM 
    date_dim d
JOIN 
    store_sales ss ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN 
    item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
WHERE 
    i.i_manager_id = 52 
    AND d.d_moy = 11 
    AND d.d_year = 2000 
GROUP BY 
    i.i_brand, 
    i.i_brand_id 
ORDER BY 
    ext_price DESC, 
    i.i_brand_id 
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Rule 1 & 2:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax.
- **Rule 3 & 4:** I used explicit JOIN conditions instead of linking tables in the WHERE clause.
- **Rule 5:** I ensured that all join conditions are explicitly stated in the JOIN clause.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the conditions related to the `item` and `date_dim` tables from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses in the JOINs. However, in this case, since the conditions `i_manager_id`, `d_moy`, and `d_year` do not directly relate to the join conditions but rather filter the rows, they are kept in the WHERE clause.

This optimized query should be more readable and maintain the intended logical execution plan while adhering to best practices for SQL writing.
