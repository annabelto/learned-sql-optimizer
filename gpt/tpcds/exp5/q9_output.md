The provided query is a complex SELECT statement with multiple subqueries, each performing calculations based on different conditions from the `store_sales` table. The main query is selecting from the `reason` table with a condition on `r_reason_sk`. The subqueries are independent of each other and of the main query, except for the condition on the `reason` table.

To optimize this query, we can focus on improving readability and potentially execution by restructuring the subqueries. However, the rules provided (1-6) are more applicable to queries involving multiple tables joined together. In this case, the subqueries are not joining additional tables but are instead filtering and aggregating data from the same table (`store_sales`) based on different conditions.

Given the nature of the query and the rules provided, here's how we can approach optimization:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

However, since the query does not involve multiple tables being joined, many of these rules do not directly apply. The main optimization opportunity here is to ensure that the query is as readable and maintainable as possible, given that performance optimizations would typically require a deeper analysis of the execution plan and indexing strategy.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN (SELECT count(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) > 1071 
        THEN (SELECT avg(ss_ext_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) 
        ELSE (SELECT avg(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) 
    END AS bucket1,
    CASE 
        WHEN (SELECT count(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) > 39161 
        THEN (SELECT avg(ss_ext_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) 
        ELSE (SELECT avg(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) 
    END AS bucket2,
    CASE 
        WHEN (SELECT count(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60) > 29434 
        THEN (SELECT avg(ss_ext_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60) 
        ELSE (SELECT avg(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60) 
    END AS bucket3,
    CASE 
        WHEN (SELECT count(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80) > 6568 
        THEN (SELECT avg(ss_ext_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80) 
        ELSE (SELECT avg(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80) 
    END AS bucket4,
    CASE 
        WHEN (SELECT count(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100) > 21216 
        THEN (SELECT avg(ss_ext_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100) 
        ELSE (SELECT avg(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100) 
    END AS bucket5
FROM reason
WHERE r_reason_sk = 1;
```

This query remains largely unchanged because the optimization rules provided do not directly apply to the structure of this query. The main change is ensuring clarity and correctness in the SQL syntax and structure.
