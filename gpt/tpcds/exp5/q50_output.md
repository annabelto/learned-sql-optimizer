To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    s_store_name,
    s_company_id,
    s_street_number,
    s_street_name,
    s_street_type,
    s_suite_number,
    s_city,
    s_county,
    s_state,
    s_zip,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 30) AND (sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 60) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 60) AND (sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 90) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 90) AND (sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM 
    store_sales
JOIN 
    store_returns ON ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk AND ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk
JOIN 
    store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d1 ON ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d2 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d2.d_year = 2001 AND d2.d_moy = 8
GROUP BY 
    s_store_name,
    s_company_id,
    s_street_number,
    s_street_name,
    s_street_type,
    s_suite_number,
    s_city,
    s_county,
    s_state,
    s_zip
ORDER BY 
    s_store_name,
    s_company_id,
    s_street_number,
    s_street_name,
    s_street_type,
    s_suite_number,
    s_city,
    s_county,
    s_state,
    s_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax, specifying the join conditions using the ON clause. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** I moved all relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs. This can help improve performance by reducing the number of rows that need to be processed in the later stages of the query execution, as the join conditions are applied earlier.
