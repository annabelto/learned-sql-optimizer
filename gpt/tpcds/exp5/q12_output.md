To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ws_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM 
    web_sales
JOIN 
    item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
WHERE 
    i_category IN ('Men', 'Books', 'Electronics')
    AND d_date BETWEEN CAST('2001-06-15' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2001-06-15' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30 days')
GROUP BY 
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
ORDER BY 
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    revenueratio
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and specified the join conditions using the ON keyword. This clarifies the relationships between the tables and ensures that the joins are correctly understood by the query planner.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the conditions related to the join (e.g., `ws_item_sk = i_item_sk` and `ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`) from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses in the JOINs. This helps in potentially reducing the dataset earlier during query execution, which can improve performance.
- I also ensured that the date range condition uses an INTERVAL for clarity and correctness in date operations.

These changes should make the query more readable and potentially improve execution efficiency by making better use of indexes and reducing the amount of data processed in later stages of the query.
