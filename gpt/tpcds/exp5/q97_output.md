To optimize the given query, we will apply several of the provided data-independent rewrite rules. The original query uses implicit joins in the CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and can be improved for clarity and potentially performance by using explicit JOIN syntax. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH ssci AS (
    SELECT 
        ss_customer_sk AS customer_sk, 
        ss_item_sk AS item_sk 
    FROM 
        store_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1199 AND 1210
    GROUP BY 
        ss_customer_sk, 
        ss_item_sk
), 
csci AS (
    SELECT 
        cs_bill_customer_sk AS customer_sk, 
        cs_item_sk AS item_sk 
    FROM 
        catalog_sales
    JOIN 
        date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE 
        d_month_seq BETWEEN 1199 AND 1210
    GROUP BY 
        cs_bill_customer_sk, 
        cs_item_sk
)
SELECT  
    SUM(CASE WHEN ssci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS store_only,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ssci.customer_sk IS NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS catalog_only,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ssci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS store_and_catalog
FROM 
    ssci 
FULL OUTER JOIN 
    csci ON ssci.customer_sk = csci.customer_sk AND ssci.item_sk = csci.item_sk
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax:** The original query used a comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause combined with a WHERE clause for joining conditions. This has been replaced with explicit JOIN clauses, which clearly define how tables are related.
- **Conditions Moved to ON Clause:** The conditions that link the `store_sales` and `date_dim` tables, as well as the `catalog_sales` and `date_dim` tables, have been moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the respective JOINs. This makes the join conditions explicit and confines the filtering logic to the JOIN itself, which can help in understanding and optimizing the query execution plan.
- **Grouping and Filtering:** The grouping and filtering remain the same but are now more clearly associated with the respective tables due to the explicit JOIN syntax.

This rewritten query should be easier to read and maintain, and depending on the database's query optimizer, it might also perform better due to clearer relationships between tables.
