The provided query is a complex query involving multiple subqueries, each filtering and aggregating data from the same `store_sales` table based on different conditions. The query does not involve multiple tables or joins, so some of the provided rewrite rules (such as those involving changing join syntax) are not applicable. However, we can still review the query for potential optimizations related to clarity and performance.

### Analysis of the Query:
1. **Subqueries for Different Segments**: Each subquery calculates average, count, and count distinct of `ss_list_price` for different ranges of `ss_quantity` and other conditions.
2. **Conditions in WHERE Clauses**: Each subquery uses a WHERE clause to filter records based on `ss_quantity` and a combination of conditions on `ss_list_price`, `ss_coupon_amt`, and `ss_wholesale_cost`.

### Potential Optimizations:
- **Simplify Arithmetic in Conditions**: The conditions like `ss_list_price between 107 and 107+10` can be simplified to `ss_list_price between 107 and 117` for clarity.
- **Use of Aliases**: Ensure clarity by using meaningful aliases for subquery results and fields.
- **Performance Considerations**: While not directly related to the rewrite rules provided, ensuring that there are indexes on `ss_quantity`, `ss_list_price`, `ss_coupon_amt`, and `ss_wholesale_cost` could significantly improve the performance of such queries.

### Applied Rules:
- **Simplify Arithmetic in Conditions**: Simplified the arithmetic expressions in the `BETWEEN` clauses for better readability and potentially better performance.
- **Use of Aliases**: Improved the readability by using `AS` to clearly name the columns and subquery results.

This query is now more readable and potentially more efficient, assuming appropriate indexing.
