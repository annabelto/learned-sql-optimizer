To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    s.s_store_name, 
    i.i_item_desc, 
    sc.revenue, 
    i.i_current_price, 
    i.i_wholesale_cost, 
    i.i_brand 
FROM 
    store s
JOIN 
    (SELECT 
         ss_store_sk, 
         ss_item_sk, 
         sum(ss_sales_price) AS revenue 
     FROM 
         store_sales
     JOIN 
         date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
     WHERE 
         d_month_seq BETWEEN 1176 AND 1176 + 11 
     GROUP BY 
         ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
    ) sc ON s.s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk
JOIN 
    item i ON i.i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
JOIN 
    (SELECT 
         ss_store_sk, 
         avg(revenue) AS ave 
     FROM 
         (SELECT 
              ss_store_sk, 
              ss_item_sk, 
              sum(ss_sales_price) AS revenue 
          FROM 
              store_sales
          JOIN 
              date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
          WHERE 
              d_month_seq BETWEEN 1176 AND 1176 + 11 
          GROUP BY 
              ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
         ) sa 
     GROUP BY 
         ss_store_sk
    ) sb ON sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk AND sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave
ORDER BY 
    s.s_store_name, 
    i.i_item_desc 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replaced comma-separated table listing in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs.
- **Explicit Join Conditions**: Moved conditions that link tables from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the corresponding JOINs.
- **Subquery Joins**: Subqueries `sa` and `sb` are used to compute aggregates before joining, which can help in reducing the size of the dataset that needs to be joined.
- **Filtering in JOINs**: Conditions related to linking `store_sales` and `date_dim` are moved to the ON clause of the JOIN between these tables, which can help in reducing the number of rows processed during the join operation.

This optimized query should perform better than the original by reducing the number of rows processed and clearly defining join conditions, which helps the database optimizer to create a more efficient execution plan.
