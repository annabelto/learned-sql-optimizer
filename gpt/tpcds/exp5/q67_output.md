To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM (
    SELECT
        i_category,
        i_class,
        i_brand,
        i_product_name,
        d_year,
        d_qoy,
        d_moy,
        s_store_id,
        sumsales,
        rank() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) AS rk
    FROM (
        SELECT
            i_category,
            i_class,
            i_brand,
            i_product_name,
            d_year,
            d_qoy,
            d_moy,
            s_store_id,
            SUM(COALESCE(ss_sales_price * ss_quantity, 0)) AS sumsales
        FROM
            store_sales
        JOIN
            date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        JOIN
            item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        JOIN
            store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        WHERE
            d_month_seq BETWEEN 1217 AND 1217 + 11
        GROUP BY
            ROLLUP(i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id)
    ) AS dw1
) AS dw2
WHERE
    rk <= 100
ORDER BY
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_brand,
    i_product_name,
    d_year,
    d_qoy,
    d_moy,
    s_store_id,
    sumsales,
    rk
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** Conditions that were part of the WHERE clause and directly related to the join logic were moved to the ON clauses. This can potentially improve performance as the join conditions are evaluated earlier in the query execution plan.

These changes should make the query more efficient and easier to maintain, while also potentially improving execution speed by allowing the database engine to optimize the join operations more effectively.
