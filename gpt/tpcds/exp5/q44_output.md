To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and specified the join conditions using the ON keyword. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the conditions that link the tables (`asceding.rnk = descending.rnk` and the item keys with `asceding.item_sk` and `descending.item_sk`) from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses in the JOINs. This helps in potentially reducing the dataset earlier during the join process rather than filtering after a Cartesian product, which can improve performance.

These changes should make the query more efficient and easier to understand and maintain.
