To optimize the provided TPC-DS query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules in the specified order:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH ws_wh AS (
    SELECT ws1.ws_order_number, ws1.ws_warehouse_sk AS wh1, ws2.ws_warehouse_sk AS wh2
    FROM web_sales ws1
    JOIN web_sales ws2 ON ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
    WHERE ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number) AS "order count",
    SUM(ws1.ws_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
    SUM(ws1.ws_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM 
    web_sales ws1
JOIN 
    date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN 
    web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site.web_site_sk
WHERE 
    date_dim.d_date BETWEEN '2001-4-01' AND (CAST('2001-4-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 days')
    AND customer_address.ca_state = 'VA'
    AND web_site.web_company_name = 'pri'
    AND ws1.ws_order_number IN (SELECT ws_order_number FROM ws_wh)
    AND ws1.ws_order_number IN (
        SELECT wr_order_number 
        FROM web_returns
        JOIN ws_wh ON web_returns.wr_order_number = ws_wh.ws_order_number
    )
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(DISTINCT ws1.ws_order_number)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replaced comma-separated table listings in the `FROM` clause with explicit `JOIN` syntax to clarify the relationships between tables.
- **Explicit Join Conditions**: Moved join conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the respective joins. This helps in understanding the join conditions directly associated with each join operation.
- **Filter Conditions**: Kept filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause that do not directly relate to joining tables but are used to filter records.
- **Subquery Joins**: In the subquery that checks for `ws_order_number` in `web_returns`, used an explicit `JOIN` to link `web_returns` and `ws_wh` based on `wr_order_number`.

These changes should make the query more readable and potentially improve execution by making explicit the primary relationships and join conditions, allowing the database engine to optimize the execution plan more effectively.
