To optimize the provided query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    a.ca_state AS state, 
    COUNT(*) AS cnt 
FROM 
    customer_address a
JOIN 
    customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
JOIN 
    store_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN 
    item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
WHERE 
    d.d_month_seq = (
        SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq 
        FROM date_dim 
        WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
    )
    AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (
        SELECT AVG(j.i_current_price) 
        FROM item j 
        WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category
    )
GROUP BY 
    a.ca_state 
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) >= 10 
ORDER BY 
    cnt, a.ca_state 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Explicit Join Syntax:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN clauses. This makes the query easier to read and understand.
   
2. **Explicit Join Conditions:** I moved the conditions that link the tables from the WHERE clause to the appropriate ON clauses in the JOINs. This helps in clearly defining the relationships between the tables and can improve performance as the join conditions are evaluated earlier.

3. **Maintained WHERE Conditions:** Conditions that do not directly link tables but instead filter records are kept in the WHERE clause. This includes the subqueries checking for specific date sequences and item prices.

4. **Grouping and Ordering:** No changes were made to the GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, or LIMIT clauses as they are already optimized for the intended aggregation and sorting operations.

This rewritten query should perform better due to clearer separation of join conditions and filtering conditions, and it adheres to best practices for SQL readability and maintainability.
