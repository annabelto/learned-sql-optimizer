### Original Query
```sql
SELECT sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM lineitem, part
WHERE (p_partkey = l_partkey AND p_brand = 'Brand#53' AND p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')
       AND l_quantity >= 10 AND l_quantity <= 20 AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5
       AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')
   OR (p_partkey = l_partkey AND p_brand = 'Brand#32' AND p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
       AND l_quantity >= 13 AND l_quantity <= 23 AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10
       AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')
   OR (p_partkey = l_partkey AND p_brand = 'Brand#41' AND p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')
       AND l_quantity >= 23 AND l_quantity <= 33 AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15
       AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions on the `part` table directly into a subquery for `part`. This reduces the size of the join by filtering rows early.
2. **Join Optimization**: Convert the implicit join (comma-separated) to an explicit `INNER JOIN` for clarity and potential performance improvement.
3. **Eliminate Redundant `LIMIT ALL`**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant as it does not limit the number of rows and can be removed for clarity.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
JOIN (
    SELECT p_partkey
    FROM part
    WHERE (p_brand = 'Brand#53' AND p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
       OR (p_brand = 'Brand#32' AND p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10)
       OR (p_brand = 'Brand#41' AND p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15)
) AS p ON p.p_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey
WHERE (l_quantity BETWEEN 10 AND 20 OR l_quantity BETWEEN 13 AND 23 OR l_quantity BETWEEN 23 AND 33)
  AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
  AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON';
```

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced join size from the filtered subquery and clearer join semantics.
