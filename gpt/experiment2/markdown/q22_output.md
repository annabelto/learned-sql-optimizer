### Original Query
```sql
SELECT cntrycode, COUNT(*) AS numcust, SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal
FROM (
    SELECT substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode, c_acctbal
    FROM customer
    WHERE substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
      AND c_acctbal > (
          SELECT AVG(c_acctbal)
          FROM customer
          WHERE c_acctbal > 0.00
            AND substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
      )
      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT *
          FROM orders
          WHERE o_custkey = c_custkey
      )
) AS custsale
GROUP BY cntrycode
ORDER BY cntrycode
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: The subquery that calculates the average account balance is repeated in the main query's `WHERE` clause. We can calculate this once and use it in the main query.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates. This reduces the amount of data processed in the outer parts of the query.

3. **Avoid Redundant LIMIT ALL**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant as it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it simplifies the query.

### Applying the Rules

1. **Common Subexpression Elimination**:
   Extract the average account balance calculation into a CTE (Common Table Expression).

2. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   Apply the filter on `c_phone` and `c_acctbal` directly in the subquery to reduce the dataset size early.

3. **Remove Redundant LIMIT ALL**:
   Simply remove the `LIMIT ALL` clause.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH avg_acctbal AS (
    SELECT AVG(c_acctbal) AS avg_balance
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_acctbal > 0.00
      AND substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
)
SELECT cntrycode, COUNT(*) AS numcust, SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal
FROM (
    SELECT substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode, c_acctbal
    FROM customer
    WHERE substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
      AND c_acctbal > (SELECT avg_balance FROM avg_acctbal)
      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1
          FROM orders
          WHERE o_custkey = c_custkey
      )
) AS custsale
GROUP BY cntrycode
ORDER BY cntrycode;
```

This optimized query reduces the number of times the average account balance is calculated by using a CTE, applies filters early to minimize the amount of data processed, and removes unnecessary SQL clauses.
