### Original Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly
FROM lineitem, part, 
     (SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 
             0.2 * AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity 
      FROM lineitem 
      GROUP BY l_partkey) part_agg 
WHERE p_partkey = l_partkey 
  AND agg_partkey = l_partkey 
  AND p_brand = 'Brand#41' 
  AND p_container = 'WRAP BAG' 
  AND l_quantity < avg_quantity 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Eliminate Cartesian Product**: The original query uses a Cartesian product by listing multiple tables in the FROM clause without explicit JOIN conditions in the FROM clause itself. This can be optimized by explicitly using JOINs, which helps in understanding the query and potentially allows the optimizer to better plan the execution.

2. **Use INNER JOINs**: Since the WHERE clause specifies conditions that link all the tables, we can convert these conditions into INNER JOINs. This will make the query more readable and may help the database optimize the join order and method.

3. **Remove Redundant LIMIT**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it simplifies the query.

4. **Column Pruning in Subquery**: The subquery selects `l_partkey` and names it `agg_partkey`, but since it's used for joining and filtering, we don't need to rename it. We can use it directly.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly
FROM part
JOIN lineitem ON part.p_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey
JOIN (
    SELECT l_partkey, 
           0.2 * AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity 
    FROM lineitem 
    GROUP BY l_partkey
) AS part_agg ON part.p_partkey = part_agg.l_partkey
WHERE part.p_brand = 'Brand#41' 
  AND part.p_container = 'WRAP BAG' 
  AND lineitem.l_quantity < part_agg.avg_quantity;
```

### Explanation of Optimization
- **Step 1 & 2**: By converting the implicit Cartesian product into explicit INNER JOINs, the query becomes clearer and potentially allows the database to better optimize the execution plan.
- **Step 3**: Removing `LIMIT ALL` simplifies the query without changing its functionality, as `LIMIT ALL` does not actually limit anything.
- **Step 4**: The subquery was simplified by removing unnecessary renaming of columns, which can help in reducing confusion and potential errors in larger queries.
