The given query is already syntactically correct. However, it can be optimized for better performance. The optimization techniques that can be applied here are:

1. Use of JOINs instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Use of subquery factoring (WITH clause) to avoid multiple subqueries on the same table.
3. Use of indexes on the columns used in the WHERE clause and JOIN conditions.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
WITH l2 AS (
    SELECT l_orderkey, l_suppkey
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM lineitem
        WHERE l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
        AND l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
    )
), l3 AS (
    SELECT l_orderkey, l_suppkey
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM lineitem
        WHERE l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
        AND l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
        AND l_receiptdate > l_commitdate
    )
)
SELECT s_name, COUNT(*) AS numwait
FROM supplier
JOIN lineitem l1 ON s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey
JOIN orders ON o_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
LEFT JOIN l2 ON l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
LEFT JOIN l3 ON l3.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
WHERE o_orderstatus = 'F'
AND l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate
AND n_name = 'KENYA'
GROUP BY s_name
ORDER BY numwait DESC, s_name
LIMIT ALL;
```

Note: The performance of the query can be further improved by creating indexes on the columns used in the WHERE clause and JOIN conditions.
