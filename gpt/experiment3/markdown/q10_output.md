The given query is already syntactically correct. However, it can be optimized by using JOINs instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause, which can improve the performance of the query. 

### Rewrite Rules Used:

1. **Join Introduction**: Replaced the comma-separated tables in the FROM clause with JOINs. This makes the query more readable and can improve performance by allowing the database to use indexes more effectively.

2. **Projection Pushdown**: Moved the calculation of the 'revenue' field into a subquery. This allows the database to calculate the revenue for each customer before applying the GROUP BY clause, which can reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.c_custkey, 
    c.c_name, 
    sub.revenue, 
    c.c_acctbal, 
    n.n_name, 
    c.c_address, 
    c.c_phone, 
    c.c_comment 
FROM 
    customer c 
JOIN 
    nation n ON c.c_nationkey = n.n_nationkey 
JOIN 
    (
        SELECT 
            o.o_custkey, 
            SUM(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount)) as revenue 
        FROM 
            orders o 
        JOIN 
            lineitem l ON l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey 
        WHERE 
            o.o_orderdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
            AND o.o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' MONTH 
            AND l.l_returnflag = 'R' 
        GROUP BY 
            o.o_custkey
    ) sub ON c.c_custkey = sub.o_custkey 
ORDER BY 
    revenue DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

This optimized query should perform better than the original, especially on large datasets.
