The given query is already syntactically correct. However, it can be optimized by reducing the number of joins and using indexes. 

### Optimization Steps:

1. **Use Indexes**: If not already done, create indexes on the columns used in the join conditions and the WHERE clause. This can significantly speed up the query execution. 

2. **Reduce the number of joins**: The query is joining six tables together, which can be quite expensive. If possible, try to reduce the number of joins. For example, if there are tables that can be excluded based on the 'p_name like \'%white%\'' condition, do that filtering first before joining with other tables.

3. **Use EXISTS instead of JOIN for checking existence**: If some tables are just used to check the existence of some records, use EXISTS or IN instead of JOIN. This can be faster because once the DBMS finds a hit, it will stop looking.

4. **Filter early**: Apply the most selective filters as early as possible to reduce the number of rows that need to be processed in the later stages of the query.

5. **Use derived tables or temporary tables**: If a part of the query is used multiple times, consider creating a derived table or a temporary table.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    nation, 
    o_year, 
    sum(amount) as sum_profit 
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            n_name as nation, 
            extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year, 
            l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity as amount 
        FROM 
            part
        INNER JOIN 
            lineitem ON p_partkey = l_partkey
        INNER JOIN 
            partsupp ON ps_partkey = l_partkey
        INNER JOIN 
            orders ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
        INNER JOIN 
            supplier ON s_suppkey = l_suppkey AND s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
        INNER JOIN 
            nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
        WHERE 
            p_name like '%white%'
    ) as profit 
GROUP BY 
    nation, 
    o_year 
ORDER BY 
    nation, 
    o_year DESC 
LIMIT ALL;
```

Note: The actual optimization may vary depending on the data distribution, table schema, and database configuration. Always test the performance of the optimized query.
