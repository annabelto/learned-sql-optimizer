The given query is a complex one with multiple joins and a subquery. The query is selecting from the tables part, supplier, partsupp, nation, and region. It is joining these tables on various conditions and filtering the results based on several conditions. It is also ordering the results and limiting the number of results returned.

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT 
    s_acctbal, s_name, n_name, p_partkey, p_mfgr, s_address, s_phone, s_comment 
FROM 
    part, supplier, partsupp, nation, region 
WHERE 
    p_partkey = ps_partkey 
    AND s_suppkey = ps_suppkey 
    AND p_size = 16 
    AND p_type LIKE '%NICKEL' 
    AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
    AND n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
    AND r_name = 'EUROPE' 
    AND ps_supplycost = (
        SELECT 
            MIN(ps_supplycost) 
        FROM 
            partsupp, supplier, nation, region 
        WHERE 
            p_partkey = ps_partkey 
            AND s_suppkey = ps_suppkey 
            AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
            AND n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
            AND r_name = 'EUROPE'
    ) 
ORDER BY 
    s_acctbal DESC, n_name, s_name, p_partkey 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Join Syntax**: The query uses old-style comma-separated join syntax. This can be rewritten using the modern JOIN syntax, which is more readable and allows for better optimization by the query planner.

2. **Subquery Elimination**: The query includes a subquery to find the minimum supply cost. This can be rewritten as a join to a derived table, which can be more efficient.

3. **Indexing**: If not already done, consider adding indexes on the columns used in the join conditions and the WHERE clause. This can significantly speed up the query.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH min_supplycost AS (
    SELECT 
        MIN(ps_supplycost) AS min_cost 
    FROM 
        partsupp 
        JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey 
        JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
        JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
    WHERE 
        r_name = 'EUROPE'
)
SELECT 
    s_acctbal, s_name, n_name, p_partkey, p_mfgr, s_address, s_phone, s_comment 
FROM 
    part 
    JOIN partsupp ON p_partkey = ps_partkey 
    JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey 
    JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
    JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
    JOIN min_supplycost ON ps_supplycost = min_cost
WHERE 
    p_size = 16 
    AND p_type LIKE '%NICKEL' 
    AND r_name = 'EUROPE' 
ORDER BY 
    s_acctbal DESC, n_name, s_name, p_partkey;
```
Note: The `LIMIT ALL` clause has been removed as it is redundant. By default, PostgreSQL will return all rows that match the query.
