To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed in the early stages of the query, which can significantly decrease the amount of data that needs to be handled in later stages.

2. **Join Elimination**: If the predicates allow, we can eliminate unnecessary joins. However, in this query, the join is necessary to match `lineitem` with `part`.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (using commas in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax (using INNER JOIN) can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it makes the join conditions more explicit.

4. **Column Pruning**: Only select the columns that are necessary for the final output or calculations within the query.

5. **Elimination of LIMIT ALL**: The `LIMIT ALL` is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows at all, which is the default behavior of SQL if no LIMIT clause is provided.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the conditions on `l_shipdate` directly into the FROM clause where `lineitem` is referenced.
2. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert the implicit join to an explicit INNER JOIN.
3. **Column Pruning**: Ensure only necessary columns are being fetched.
4. **Elimination of LIMIT ALL**: Remove the `LIMIT ALL` clause as it serves no purpose.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 100.00 * SUM(CASE 
                       WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) 
                       ELSE 0 
                   END) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS promo_revenue
FROM lineitem
INNER JOIN part ON lineitem.l_partkey = part.p_partkey
WHERE lineitem.l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-10-01'
  AND lineitem.l_shipdate < DATE '1995-10-01' + INTERVAL '1 month';
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query now uses `INNER JOIN` which makes the join condition between `lineitem` and `part` explicit.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `l_shipdate` are included in the WHERE clause immediately after the tables are referenced, which can help the database optimize the retrieval of data from `lineitem`.
- **Column Pruning**: The SELECT clause only computes necessary values for the final output.
- **Elimination of LIMIT ALL**: Removed the redundant `LIMIT ALL` clause.

These changes should make the query more efficient in terms of execution plan generation and potentially reduce the execution time by reducing the amount of data processed and clearly defining join conditions.
