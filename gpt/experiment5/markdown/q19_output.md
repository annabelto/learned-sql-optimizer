To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance by reducing the amount of data processed and simplifying the conditions. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the number of rows processed in the joins and subsequent operations.

2. **Simplify Expressions**: Simplify the range checks for `l_quantity` to make them more readable and potentially more efficient for the query planner.

3. **Use Explicit JOINs**: Convert implicit joins (comma-separated in FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax. This improves readability and can help the database optimizer understand the relationship between tables better.

4. **Eliminate Redundant Conditions**: Since `l_shipmode` and `l_shipinstruct` are common across all OR conditions, they can be factored out.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM part
JOIN lineitem ON p_partkey = l_partkey
WHERE (
    (
        p_brand = 'Brand#53' AND
        p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND
        l_quantity BETWEEN 10 AND 20 AND
        p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5
    ) OR (
        p_brand = 'Brand#32' AND
        p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND
        l_quantity BETWEEN 13 AND 23 AND
        p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10
    ) OR (
        p_brand = 'Brand#41' AND
        p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND
        l_quantity BETWEEN 23 AND 33 AND
        p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15
    )
) AND
l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND
l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `p_brand`, `p_container`, `l_quantity`, `p_size`, `l_shipmode`, and `l_shipinstruct` are pushed down to be evaluated immediately after the join, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in the aggregation stage.
- **Simplify Expressions**: The `l_quantity` checks are simplified to use `BETWEEN` which is more readable and can be more efficiently executed by some database systems.
- **Use Explicit JOINs**: The query now uses an explicit JOIN between `part` and `lineitem`, which is clearer and can help the optimizer.
- **Eliminate Redundant Conditions**: The conditions on `l_shipmode` and `l_shipinstruct` are factored out of the OR blocks since they are common to all, reducing complexity in the WHERE clause.

These optimizations should help improve the performance of the query by reducing the computational load and making the execution plan more efficient.
