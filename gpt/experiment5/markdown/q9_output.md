To achieve better performance than the original query, we need to focus on refining the execution strategy, particularly by ensuring that the joins are efficient and that the filtering conditions are applied as effectively as possible. We will also consider the impact of function calls and the order of operations.

### Revised Optimization Strategy:
1. **Optimize Join Conditions**: Ensure that joins are performed on indexed columns and that the most restrictive conditions are applied first to minimize the row count early in the query execution.
2. **Reduce Function Calls**: Minimize the number of function calls, especially within loops or large table scans.
3. **Leverage Indexes**: Ensure that the database has appropriate indexes for the columns used in joins and where clauses, particularly for the filtering on `p_name`.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    n.n_name AS nation,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.o_orderdate) AS o_year,
    SUM(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount) - ps.ps_supplycost * l.l_quantity) AS sum_profit
FROM 
    part p
JOIN 
    partsupp ps ON p.p_partkey = ps.ps_partkey
JOIN 
    lineitem l ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey AND l.l_suppkey = ps.ps_suppkey
JOIN 
    orders o ON l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
JOIN 
    supplier s ON s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
JOIN 
    nation n ON n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
WHERE 
    p.p_name LIKE '%white%'
GROUP BY 
    n.n_name, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.o_orderdate)
ORDER BY 
    n.n_name, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.o_orderdate) DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Key Changes:
- **Join Order**: The join order has been adjusted to ensure that the most restrictive join conditions are applied first. This should help in reducing the number of rows processed early in the execution.
- **Function Call Optimization**: The `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.o_orderdate)` function is called once per row in the final select and grouping, rather than multiple times or in a subquery.
- **Filter Application**: The filter on `p.p_name` is applied directly in the main query where the `part` table is joined, which should help in reducing the number of rows processed early in the execution.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Indexing**: Confirm that there are indexes on `p_partkey`, `ps_partkey`, `ps_suppkey`, `l_partkey`, `l_suppkey`, `o_orderkey`, `n_nationkey`, and `s_nationkey`. An index on `p_name` for the `LIKE` operation can also significantly improve performance.
- **Statistics**: Ensure that the database statistics are up to date to help the optimizer make informed decisions about the execution plan.

This approach focuses on streamlining the execution by optimizing join conditions, reducing function calls, and ensuring effective use of indexes, which should ideally lead to performance improvements over the original query.
