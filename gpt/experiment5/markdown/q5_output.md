I apologize for the oversight in the previous attempts. Let's correct the syntax and ensure the query is optimized correctly.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT n_name, SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM region
JOIN nation ON region.r_regionkey = nation.n_regionkey
JOIN supplier ON nation.n_nationkey = supplier.s_nationkey
JOIN customer ON supplier.s_nationkey = customer.c_nationkey
JOIN orders ON customer.c_custkey = orders.o_custkey
    AND orders.o_orderdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
    AND orders.o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' year
JOIN lineitem ON orders.o_orderkey = lineitem.l_orderkey
    AND lineitem.l_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey
WHERE region.r_name = 'MIDDLE EAST'
GROUP BY n_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Key Adjustments and Justifications:
- **Corrected Syntax**: The syntax error was due to incorrect placement and formatting in the previous queries. This version correctly formats the JOIN clauses and WHERE conditions.
- **Join Order**: The join order starts with the `region` table, which has a highly selective filter (`r_name = 'MIDDLE EAST'). This should help in reducing the dataset size early in the query execution.
- **Date Filtering on Orders**: The date conditions are applied directly in the join condition with `orders`, which reduces the number of `orders` rows that need to be joined with `lineitem`.
- **Efficient Use of Indexes**: This approach assumes that there are effective indexes on the join columns (`r_regionkey`, `n_nationkey`, `s_nationkey`, `c_custkey`, `o_custkey`, `o_orderkey`, `s_suppkey`) and on the columns used in WHERE clauses (`o_orderdate`, `r_name`). Proper indexing is crucial for performance.

This corrected and optimized query should now execute without syntax errors and provide better performance by leveraging selective filters early and reducing the volume of data processed in each step.
