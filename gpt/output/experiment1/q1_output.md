To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply a series of data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the steps and the rules applied:

### 1. Predicate Pushdown
**Rule Applied:** Move the filter condition (`WHERE` clause) as close as possible to the data retrieval operation. This reduces the number of rows processed in the subsequent steps of the query.

**Original Query:**
```sql
SELECT l_returnflag, l_linestatus,
       SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty,
       SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price,
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price,
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge,
       AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty,
       AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price,
       AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc,
       COUNT(*) AS count_order
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL ':1' DAY
GROUP BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus
ORDER BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus;
```

**Optimized Query:**
No change needed here as the predicate is already pushed down.

### 2. Use of Covering Index
**Rule Applied:** If possible, use a covering index that includes the columns used in the `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` clauses, as well as the columns used in the aggregate functions. This can significantly speed up data retrieval and aggregation by reducing disk I/O and leveraging index-only scans.

**Suggested Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lineitem_optimization ON lineitem(l_shipdate, l_returnflag, l_linestatus, l_quantity, l_extendedprice, l_discount, l_tax);
```

### 3. Simplify Expressions
**Rule Applied:** Simplify arithmetic expressions in the `SELECT` clause to reduce computational overhead.

**Optimized Query:**
```sql
SELECT l_returnflag, l_linestatus,
       SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty,
       SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price,
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price,
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge,
       AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty,
       AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price,
       AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc,
       COUNT(*) AS count_order
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL ':1' DAY
GROUP BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus
ORDER BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus;
```
No further simplification is possible without changing the meaning of the expressions.

### 4. Early Aggregation
**Rule Applied:** Perform aggregation as early as possible to reduce the volume of data being processed in later stages of the query.

**Optimized Query:**
Already optimized in this regard, as aggregation is performed immediately after filtering and before ordering.

### 5. Sorting and Grouping Optimization
**Rule Applied:** Ensure that the `ORDER BY` clause aligns with the `GROUP BY` clause to utilize the sorting already done during grouping, avoiding additional sort operations.

**Optimized Query:**
Already optimized as the `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` clauses are aligned.

### Conclusion
The main optimization opportunities for this query lie in the use of a covering index and ensuring that the database engine can leverage index scans effectively. The query itself is well-structured with respect to the SQL operations order and does not require further optimization in terms of the SQL syntax or operation order.
