To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply a combination of data-independent rewrite rules that focus on simplifying and restructuring the query for better performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Constant Folding**: This rule simplifies expressions involving constants. In the query, the expression `date '1998-12-01' - interval ':1' day` can be precomputed if `:1` is a constant. Assuming `:1` is a placeholder for a constant value (e.g., 30 days), this expression can be simplified to a specific date, such as `date '1998-12-01' - interval '30' day`.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**: This optimization moves the filter as close as possible to the data source. In this query, the filter on `l_shipdate` is already at the base table, so no further action is needed here.

3. **Removing Redundant Group By**: The `GROUP BY` clause is essential for the aggregation in this query, and there are no redundant columns, so no action is needed here.

4. **Use of Indexes**: If there's an index on `l_shipdate`, the database can use it to quickly filter rows before performing aggregation. This isn't a rewrite rule per se but a recommendation for physical database tuning.

5. **Order of Operations in SELECT**: The order of operations (aggregations and calculations) in the `SELECT` clause is already optimal since each aggregation is computed directly from the available columns or simple expressions thereof.

Here's the optimized query assuming `:1` is replaced with a constant (e.g., 30 days):

```sql
SELECT 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus, 
    SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
    AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
    AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
    AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
    COUNT(*) AS count_order 
FROM 
    lineitem 
WHERE 
    l_shipdate <= date '1998-12-01' - interval '30' day 
GROUP BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
ORDER BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus;
```

In this optimized query:
- **Constant Folding** was applied to precompute the date expression.
- **Predicate Pushdown** was considered but already optimally placed.
- **Removing Redundant Group By** and **Order of Operations in SELECT** were reviewed and found to be optimal as is.

This query should perform efficiently on a PostgreSQL database, especially if appropriate indexes are in place.
