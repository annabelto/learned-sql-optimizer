To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to where the data originates, which can reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If the predicates allow, we can eliminate unnecessary joins. However, in this query, the join between `lineitem` and `part` is necessary due to the filter conditions and the columns used in the SELECT clause.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This improves readability and is generally preferred over implicit joins for clarity.

4. **Column Pruning**: Ensure only necessary columns are fetched in the SELECT and JOIN clauses.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    100.00 * SUM(
        CASE 
            WHEN p.p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount) 
            ELSE 0 
        END
    ) / SUM(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount)) AS promo_revenue
FROM 
    lineitem l
JOIN 
    part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
WHERE 
    l.l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-10-01' 
    AND l.l_shipdate < DATE '1995-10-01' + INTERVAL '1 month'
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `l_shipdate` are applied directly in the WHERE clause, which helps in reducing the number of rows joined from the `lineitem` table.

2. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit join to an explicit INNER JOIN for better readability and understanding.

3. **Column Pruning**: The SELECT and JOIN clauses only include the necessary columns (`l_extendedprice`, `l_discount`, `p_type`, and keys for join conditions).

This rewritten query should be more efficient in terms of execution, as it minimizes the amount of data processed and clearly specifies the join conditions and necessary columns.
