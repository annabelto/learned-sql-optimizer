To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Constant Folding**: Simplify expressions that involve constants.
2. **Predicate Simplification**: Simplify and clarify the range conditions in the WHERE clause.
3. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Remove unnecessary expressions or clauses.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.03 - 0.01 AND 0.03 + 0.01
  AND l_quantity < 25
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Constant Folding**:
   - Simplify `DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR` to `DATE '1996-01-01'`.
   - Simplify `0.03 - 0.01` to `0.02` and `0.03 + 0.01` to `0.04`.

2. **Predicate Simplification**:
   - The `BETWEEN` expression for `l_discount` can be simplified to `l_discount BETWEEN 0.02 AND 0.04`.

3. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**:
   - `LIMIT ALL` is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. It can be removed for clarity unless explicitly required for some framework or ORM compatibility.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1996-01-01'
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.02 AND 0.04
  AND l_quantity < 25;
```

This rewritten query is more straightforward and potentially more efficient due to the simplification of constant expressions and the removal of redundant clauses. The database engine can better optimize the execution plan with these clearer expressions.
