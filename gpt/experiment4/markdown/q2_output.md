To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the semantics of the query. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates into subqueries or joins where they can be applied earlier in the execution. This reduces the number of rows processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, and if the filtering can be achieved by other means (e.g., using exists), the join can be eliminated.

3. **Subquery to Join Transformation**: Transforming correlated subqueries into joins can help in utilizing indexes and allows for better optimization by the query planner.

4. **Use of EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries**: This can be more efficient as EXISTS will stop processing as soon as it finds the first matching record.

5. **Removing Redundant Columns**: Eliminate columns from SELECT and JOIN clauses that are not needed for the final output or filtering.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT s_acctbal, s_name, n_name, p_partkey, p_mfgr, s_address, s_phone, s_comment
FROM part
JOIN partsupp ON p_partkey = ps_partkey
JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey
WHERE p_size = 16
  AND p_type LIKE '%NICKEL'
  AND r_name = 'EUROPE'
  AND ps_supplycost = (
    SELECT MIN(ps_supplycost)
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
    JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey
    WHERE p_partkey = ps_partkey
      AND r_name = 'EUROPE'
  )
ORDER BY s_acctbal DESC, n_name, s_name, p_partkey
LIMIT ALL;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moved the predicates related to `p_size`, `p_type`, and `r_name` directly into the WHERE clause and ensured they are used in the subquery as well.
- **Subquery to Join Transformation**: Kept the subquery as it is used for a scalar comparison (`ps_supplycost`), but ensured that all necessary joins and filters are present.
- **Use of EXISTS**: Not applied here as the subquery is used for a scalar value (`MIN(ps_supplycost)`), which is necessary for the comparison.
- **Removing Redundant Columns**: Ensured that only the columns needed for the final output are selected and involved in the joins.

This optimized query should perform better due to more efficient use of joins and early filtering of rows.
