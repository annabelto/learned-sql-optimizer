To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result set. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving predicates (conditions) as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: Adjusting the order of joins can significantly impact performance, especially if it allows us to reduce the size of intermediate results early in the query execution.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it clearly separates join conditions from filter conditions.

### Applying the Rules:

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown:
We push conditions related to `n1.n_name` and `n2.n_name` directly into the subquery to reduce the number of rows processed in the joins and the outer query.

#### 2. Join Reordering:
Given the selective nature of the nation names and the date range, we should join `nation` tables with `supplier` and `customer` first, as these are likely to significantly reduce the number of tuples early on.

#### 3. Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax:
Convert implicit joins to explicit joins for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year, SUM(volume) AS revenue
FROM (
    SELECT
        n1.n_name AS supp_nation,
        n2.n_name AS cust_nation,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM l.l_shipdate) AS l_year,
        l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount) AS volume
    FROM
        nation n1
        JOIN supplier s ON s.s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
        JOIN lineitem l ON s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
        JOIN orders o ON l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
        JOIN customer c ON o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
        JOIN nation n2 ON c.c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
    WHERE
        ((n1.n_name = 'CANADA' AND n2.n_name = 'MOZAMBIQUE') OR (n1.n_name = 'MOZAMBIQUE' AND n2.n_name = 'CANADA'))
        AND l.l_shipdate BETWEEN DATE '1995-01-01' AND DATE '1996-12-31'
) AS shipping
GROUP BY supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year
ORDER BY supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year
LIMIT ALL;
```

In this optimized query, the explicit JOIN syntax clarifies the relationships between tables, and the predicate pushdown ensures that the filtering happens as early as possible, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages of the query.
