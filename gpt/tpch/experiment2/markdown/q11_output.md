### Original Query
```sql
SELECT ps_partkey, SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS value
FROM partsupp, supplier, nation
WHERE ps_suppkey = s_suppkey AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey AND n_name = 'FRANCE'
GROUP BY ps_partkey
HAVING SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (
    SELECT SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000
    FROM partsupp, supplier, nation
    WHERE ps_suppkey = s_suppkey AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey AND n_name = 'FRANCE'
)
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the condition `n_name = 'FRANCE'` closer to the table `nation` in the subquery and main query. This reduces the number of rows early in the processing.

2. **Join Elimination in Subquery**: Since the subquery is only used to calculate a scalar value (a constant threshold based on the total sum), and it does not depend on `ps_partkey`, we can compute this value once and use it in the `HAVING` clause. This avoids recalculating the same value for each group in the outer query.

3. **Use of Explicit JOINs**: Convert implicit joins (comma-separated) to explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and understanding.

4. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Calculate the threshold value once and reuse it in the `HAVING` clause.

5. **LIMIT ALL Optimization**: `LIMIT ALL` is functionally equivalent to omitting the LIMIT clause, as it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it can avoid unnecessary confusion or checks in the query plan.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH france_parts AS (
    SELECT ps_partkey, ps_suppkey, ps_supplycost, ps_availqty
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN supplier ON ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
    JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    WHERE n_name = 'FRANCE'
),
total_threshold AS (
    SELECT SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000 AS threshold
    FROM france_parts
)
SELECT ps_partkey, SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS value
FROM france_parts
GROUP BY ps_partkey
HAVING SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (SELECT threshold FROM total_threshold)
ORDER BY value DESC;
```

### Explanation of Optimized Query
- **WITH Clauses**: `france_parts` collects all relevant rows matching the `FRANCE` condition, reducing the dataset size early. `total_threshold` computes the threshold once.
- **Explicit JOINs and WHERE Clause**: Improves the clarity of the query and ensures that filtering happens as early as possible.
- **Common Subexpression Elimination**: The threshold is computed once and reused, which is more efficient than recalculating for each group.
- **Removed `LIMIT ALL`**: Simplifies the query without changing its behavior, potentially avoiding unnecessary processing in the execution plan.
