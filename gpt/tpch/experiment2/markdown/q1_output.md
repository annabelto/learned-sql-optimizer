The provided query is already syntactically correct and functional. It retrieves various aggregate statistics from the `lineitem` table, filtered by a specific shipping date, and groups the results by `l_returnflag` and `l_linestatus`. The query also orders the results by these two columns and uses `LIMIT ALL` which effectively does not limit the number of rows returned.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT l_returnflag, l_linestatus, 
       SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
       AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
       AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
       AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
       COUNT(*) AS count_order 
FROM lineitem 
WHERE l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '70' DAY 
GROUP BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus 
ORDER BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps:
1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule involves moving the filter as close as possible to the data source. In this query, the filter on `l_shipdate` is already at the most optimal position, directly in the `WHERE` clause.

2. **Remove Redundant Limit**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it will not change the result but can simplify the query execution plan.

3. **Use of Indexes**: If not already present, recommending the use of an index on the columns used in filtering (`l_shipdate`) and grouping (`l_returnflag`, `l_linestatus`) can significantly improve performance. This is not a rewrite of the SQL itself but a structural optimization.

4. **Column Pruning**: Ensure that only the necessary columns are fetched in the query. This query already does this well by only selecting the columns needed for the final output.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT l_returnflag, l_linestatus, 
       SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
       AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
       AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
       AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
       COUNT(*) AS count_order 
FROM lineitem 
WHERE l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '70' DAY 
GROUP BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus 
ORDER BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus;
```

In this optimized version, I have removed the `LIMIT ALL` clause. Additionally, I recommend checking if appropriate indexes are in place to support the `WHERE` and `GROUP BY` clauses for better performance.
