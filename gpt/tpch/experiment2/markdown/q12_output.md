### Original Query
```sql
SELECT l_shipmode, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' OR o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_line_count, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' AND o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS low_line_count 
FROM orders, lineitem 
WHERE o_orderkey = l_orderkey 
  AND l_shipmode IN ('RAIL', 'TRUCK') 
  AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate 
  AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate 
  AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
  AND l_receiptdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR 
GROUP BY l_shipmode 
ORDER BY l_shipmode 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages of the query.

2. **Use Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace the implicit JOIN in the FROM clause with an explicit INNER JOIN for better readability and understanding.

3. **Simplify CASE Statements**: Simplify the logic in the CASE statements to make them more readable and potentially improve performance by reducing complexity.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT l_shipmode, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority IN ('1-URGENT', '2-HIGH') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_line_count, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority NOT IN ('1-URGENT', '2-HIGH') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS low_line_count 
FROM orders 
JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey 
WHERE l_shipmode IN ('RAIL', 'TRUCK') 
  AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate 
  AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate 
  AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
  AND l_receiptdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR 
GROUP BY l_shipmode 
ORDER BY l_shipmode 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The WHERE clause conditions are already close to the data sources, so no changes were needed here.
- **Use Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit JOIN to an explicit INNER JOIN for clarity.
- **Simplify CASE Statements**: Changed the CASE WHEN conditions to use IN and NOT IN, which simplifies the logic and potentially improves performance by reducing the number of comparisons needed.

These changes should make the query more efficient and easier to maintain, while still achieving the same result set.
