### Original Query

```sql
create view revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) as 
    select l_suppkey, sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) 
    from lineitem 
    where l_shipdate >= date '1996-07-01' and l_shipdate < date '1996-07-01' + interval '3' month 
    group by l_suppkey;

select s_suppkey, s_name, s_address, s_phone, total_revenue 
from supplier, revenue0 
where s_suppkey = supplier_no 
    and total_revenue = (select max(total_revenue) from revenue0) 
order by s_suppkey 
LIMIT ALL;

drop view revenue0;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates. This reduces the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Simplification**: Replace the Cartesian product with an explicit JOIN condition to make the query more readable and potentially allow the optimizer to use more efficient join algorithms.

3. **Subquery Factorization**: Replace the correlated subquery with a join to a derived table that calculates the maximum revenue once, rather than recalculating it for each row.

4. **View Materialization**: The view `revenue0` is used multiple times in the query. Materializing this view can avoid recalculating the same data.

### Optimized Query

```sql
-- Materialize the view inline to avoid multiple calculations
WITH revenue0 AS (
    SELECT l_suppkey AS supplier_no, SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS total_revenue
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1996-07-01' AND l_shipdate < DATE '1996-07-01' + INTERVAL '3' month
    GROUP BY l_suppkey
), max_revenue AS (
    SELECT MAX(total_revenue) AS max_total_revenue
    FROM revenue0
)
SELECT s.s_suppkey, s.s_name, s.s_address, s.s_phone, r.total_revenue
FROM supplier s
JOIN revenue0 r ON s.s_suppkey = r.supplier_no
JOIN max_revenue m ON r.total_revenue = m.max_total_revenue
ORDER BY s.s_suppkey
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Optimization

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied in the `revenue0` CTE where the date filter is applied directly in the subquery.
- **Join Simplification**: The Cartesian product in the original query is replaced with explicit JOINs, which are clearer and can be optimized better by the database engine.
- **Subquery Factorization**: The subquery to find the maximum total revenue is factored out into its own CTE (`max_revenue`), which is computed once and then joined to the main query.
- **View Materialization**: The `revenue0` view is materialized as a CTE, which can be more efficient as it avoids recalculating the same data for the subquery and main query.
