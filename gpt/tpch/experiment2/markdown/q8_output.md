### Original Query
```sql
select o_year, 
       sum(case when nation = 'MOZAMBIQUE' then volume else 0 end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share 
from (
    select extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year, 
           l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume, 
           n2.n_name as nation 
    from part, supplier, lineitem, orders, customer, nation n1, nation n2, region 
    where p_partkey = l_partkey 
      and s_suppkey = l_suppkey 
      and l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
      and o_custkey = c_custkey 
      and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey 
      and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
      and r_name = 'AFRICA' 
      and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey 
      and o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31' 
      and p_type = 'PROMO BRUSHED BRASS'
) as all_nations 
group by o_year 
order by o_year 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates. This reduces the amount of data processed in the upper layers of the query.

2. **Join Reduction**: Reduce the number of joins by eliminating unnecessary tables if possible.

3. **Use of Proper Joins**: Replace implicit joins in the WHERE clause with explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

4. **Column Pruning**: Only select columns that are necessary for the final output or conditions.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Push conditions on `o_orderdate`, `p_type`, and `r_name` closer to the respective table scans.

2. **Use of Proper Joins**: Convert the implicit joins to explicit JOINs, which can help in understanding and optimizing the query.

3. **Column Pruning**: Ensure that only the necessary columns are being selected in the subquery.

### Optimized Query
```sql
select o_year, 
       sum(case when nation = 'MOZAMBIQUE' then volume else 0 end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share 
from (
    select extract(year from o.o_orderdate) as o_year, 
           l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount) as volume, 
           n2.n_name as nation 
    from part p
    join lineitem l on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
    join orders o on l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
    join customer c on o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
    join nation n1 on c.c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
    join region r on n1.n_regionkey = r.r_regionkey
    join supplier s on l.l_suppkey = s.s_suppkey
    join nation n2 on s.s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
    where r.r_name = 'AFRICA'
      and o.o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
      and p.p_type = 'PROMO BRUSHED BRASS'
) as all_nations 
group by o_year 
order by o_year 
LIMIT ALL;
```

This optimized query uses explicit JOINs to clarify relationships and ensure that the optimizer has the best chance to use indexes effectively. Predicate pushdown and column pruning help reduce the amount of data processed and transferred between operations.
