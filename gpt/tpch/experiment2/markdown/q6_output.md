### Original Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1 year'
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.03 - 0.01 AND 0.03 + 0.01
  AND l_quantity < 25
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps and Rules Applied

1. **Constant Folding**: Simplify constant expressions.
   - `0.03 - 0.01` becomes `0.02`
   - `0.03 + 0.01` becomes `0.04`
   - `DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1 year'` becomes `DATE '1996-01-01'`

2. **Remove Redundant LIMIT**: `LIMIT ALL` essentially means no limit, so it can be removed as it does not affect the query.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1996-01-01'
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.02 AND 0.04
  AND l_quantity < 25;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to the simplification of constant expressions and removal of unnecessary clauses.
