### Original Query
```sql
SELECT p_brand, p_type, p_size, COUNT(DISTINCT ps_suppkey) AS supplier_cnt 
FROM partsupp, part 
WHERE p_partkey = ps_partkey 
  AND p_brand <> 'Brand#24' 
  AND p_type NOT LIKE 'STANDARD BURNISHED%' 
  AND p_size IN (44, 6, 46, 36, 42, 17, 26, 18) 
  AND ps_suppkey NOT IN (
    SELECT s_suppkey 
    FROM supplier 
    WHERE s_comment LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
  ) 
GROUP BY p_brand, p_type, p_size 
ORDER BY supplier_cnt DESC, p_brand, p_type, p_size 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates. This reduces the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Use JOIN Instead of Comma-Separated FROM Clause**: Explicitly using JOIN can help the query planner optimize the query better.
3. **Use LEFT JOIN and IS NULL Instead of NOT IN for Subquery**: This can be more efficient, especially if the subquery returns a large number of rows.
4. **Remove Redundant LIMIT ALL**: `LIMIT ALL` is redundant as it does not limit the result set.

### Applying the Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Apply filters directly in the JOIN condition where possible.
2. **Use JOIN Instead of Comma-Separated FROM Clause**: Convert the comma-separated FROM clause to an explicit JOIN.
3. **Use LEFT JOIN and IS NULL Instead of NOT IN for Subquery**: Replace the NOT IN subquery with a LEFT JOIN and check for NULLs.
4. **Remove Redundant LIMIT ALL**: Simply remove the `LIMIT ALL` clause.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT p.p_brand, p.p_type, p.p_size, COUNT(DISTINCT ps.ps_suppkey) AS supplier_cnt 
FROM part p
JOIN partsupp ps ON p.p_partkey = ps.ps_partkey 
LEFT JOIN supplier s ON ps.ps_suppkey = s.s_suppkey AND s.s_comment LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
WHERE p.p_brand <> 'Brand#24' 
  AND p.p_type NOT LIKE 'STANDARD BURNISHED%' 
  AND p.p_size IN (44, 6, 46, 36, 42, 17, 26, 18) 
  AND s.s_suppkey IS NULL
GROUP BY p.p_brand, p.p_type, p.p_size 
ORDER BY supplier_cnt DESC, p.p_brand, p.p_type, p.p_size;
```

This rewritten query should perform better due to more efficient JOIN operations and filtering, reducing the amount of data being processed and grouped in the later stages of the query.
