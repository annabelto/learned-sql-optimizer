### Original Query Analysis
The original query provided is:
```sql
select c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, sum(l_quantity)
from customer, orders, lineitem
where o_orderkey in (
    select l_orderkey
    from lineitem
    group by l_orderkey
    having sum(l_quantity) > 313
)
and c_custkey = o_custkey
and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
group by c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice
order by o_totalprice desc, o_orderdate
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

#### 1. Use Explicit JOINs
Using explicit JOINs instead of implicit joins in the WHERE clause can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it clearly separates join conditions from filter conditions.

#### 2. Push JOIN Conditions Up
Move the conditions on joins (`c_custkey = o_custkey` and `o_orderkey = l_orderkey`) directly into the ON clauses of the JOINs. This can help the query planner by reducing the number of rows early in the query processing.

#### 3. Use Subquery in JOIN Instead of IN
Transform the subquery that uses IN into a JOIN. This can be more efficient as it allows the database to possibly use more optimal join methods like hash joins or merge joins.

#### 4. Remove Redundant LIMIT ALL
`LIMIT ALL` is functionally equivalent to not having a LIMIT clause at all, as it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it can avoid unnecessary parsing and planning overhead.

### Applying the Rules

**Step 1: Use Explicit JOINs**
```sql
select c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, sum(l_quantity)
from customer
join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey
join lineitem on o_orderkey = l_orderkey
where o_orderkey in (
    select l_orderkey
    from lineitem
    group by l_orderkey
    having sum(l_quantity) > 313
)
group by c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice
order by o_totalprice desc, o_orderdate;
```

**Step 2: Push JOIN Conditions Up**
Already applied in Step 1 by moving conditions into the ON clauses.

**Step 3: Use Subquery in JOIN Instead of IN**
```sql
select c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, sum(l_quantity)
from customer
join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey
join lineitem on o_orderkey = l_orderkey
join (
    select l_orderkey
    from lineitem
    group by l_orderkey
    having sum(l_quantity) > 313
) as filtered_lineitems on o_orderkey = filtered_lineitems.l_orderkey
group by c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice
order by o_totalprice desc, o_orderdate;
```

**Step 4: Remove Redundant LIMIT ALL**
Already applied by omission in the final query.

### Optimized Query
```sql
select c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, sum(l_quantity)
from customer
join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey
join lineitem on o_orderkey = l_orderkey
join (
    select l_orderkey
    from lineitem
    group by l_orderkey
    having sum(l_quantity) > 313
) as filtered_lineitems on o_orderkey = filtered_lineitems.l_orderkey
group by c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice
order by o_totalprice desc, o_orderdate;
```
This rewritten query should be more efficient and clearer in intent than the original query.
