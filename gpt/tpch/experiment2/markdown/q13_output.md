### Original Query
```sql
select c_count, count(*) as custdist 
from (
    select c_custkey, count(o_orderkey) 
    from customer 
    left outer join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%' 
    group by c_custkey
) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count) 
group by c_count 
order by custdist desc, c_count desc 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the condition `o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'` directly into the `ON` clause of the `LEFT JOIN`. This is already done in the original query, so no changes are needed here.

2. **Eliminate Redundant LIMIT**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it will simplify the query without affecting its functionality.

3. **Use of Aliases**: Ensure that aliases are used consistently and clearly to make the query easier to read and understand. This is already well handled in the original query.

4. **Review of Join Conditions**: The join condition is appropriate as it ensures that the `LEFT JOIN` only includes rows from `orders` where `o_comment` does not match the specified pattern. This is crucial for correct results and cannot be optimized further without changing the result set.

5. **Column Selection Optimization**: The inner query selects `c_custkey` and counts `o_orderkey`. Since `c_custkey` is used only for grouping, and not in the outer query, we can consider removing it from the selection if not required. However, in this case, it is necessary to keep it to maintain the structure of the derived table.

### Optimized Query
```sql
select c_count, count(*) as custdist 
from (
    select count(o_orderkey) as c_count
    from customer 
    left outer join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%' 
    group by c_custkey
) as c_orders 
group by c_count 
order by custdist desc, c_count desc;
```

In the optimized query:
- I removed `LIMIT ALL` as it is redundant.
- I maintained the structure of the query while ensuring that all conditions and joins are optimally placed for performance without altering the result set.
