### Original Query
```sql
SELECT o_orderpriority, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
WHERE o_orderdate >= DATE '1996-01-01'
  AND o_orderdate < DATE '1996-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' MONTH
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM lineitem 
    WHERE l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
      AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
  )
GROUP BY o_orderpriority
ORDER BY o_orderpriority
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the condition `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate` directly into the subquery's WHERE clause to reduce the number of rows processed by the EXISTS clause.

2. **Use of JOIN instead of EXISTS**: Convert the EXISTS clause to an INNER JOIN, as this can be more efficient in cases where the database can utilize indexes effectively. This also allows for better use of join algorithms by the database engine.

3. **Elimination of Redundant LIMIT**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it simplifies the query plan.

4. **Index Suggestion**: Although not part of the SQL rewrite, suggesting the use of appropriate indexes can significantly improve performance. For instance, indexes on `orders(o_orderdate, o_orderkey)` and `lineitem(l_orderkey, l_commitdate, l_receiptdate)` would be beneficial.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT o.o_orderpriority, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders o
JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
WHERE o.o_orderdate >= DATE '1996-01-01'
  AND o.o_orderdate < DATE '1996-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' MONTH
  AND l.l_commitdate < l.l_receiptdate
GROUP BY o.o_orderpriority
ORDER BY o.o_orderpriority;
```

### Explanation of Optimization
- **Predicate Pushdown**: By pushing the predicate `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate` into the JOIN condition, the database can eliminate non-matching `lineitem` records earlier in the query processing.
- **Use of JOIN instead of EXISTS**: This change allows the database to potentially use more efficient join methods and can help in utilizing indexes more effectively. It also makes the query easier to understand and maintain by reducing nested subqueries.
- **Elimination of Redundant LIMIT**: Removing `LIMIT ALL` simplifies the query execution plan as the database does not need to consider any row count limitation.
- **Index Suggestion**: While not directly visible in the query text, recommending the creation of specific indexes helps ensure that the database can quickly locate the relevant rows for both the `orders` and `lineitem` tables, thus speeding up the join operation and the overall query execution.
