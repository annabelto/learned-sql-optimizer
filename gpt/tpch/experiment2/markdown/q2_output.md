### Original Query
```sql
SELECT s_acctbal, s_name, n_name, p_partkey, p_mfgr, s_address, s_phone, s_comment 
FROM part, supplier, partsupp, nation, region 
WHERE p_partkey = ps_partkey 
  AND s_suppkey = ps_suppkey 
  AND p_size = 16 
  AND p_type LIKE '%NICKEL' 
  AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
  AND n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
  AND r_name = 'EUROPE' 
  AND ps_supplycost = (
    SELECT MIN(ps_supplycost) 
    FROM partsupp, supplier, nation, region 
    WHERE p_partkey = ps_partkey 
      AND s_suppkey = ps_suppkey 
      AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
      AND n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
      AND r_name = 'EUROPE'
  ) 
ORDER BY s_acctbal DESC, n_name, s_name, p_partkey 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates. This reduces the amount of data processed in the subquery and main query.
2. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins. If a table in a join does not contribute to the final result set (either through selection or aggregation), it can be removed.
3. **Use Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This improves readability and potentially allows the optimizer to better understand the query structure.
4. **Remove Redundant LIMIT**: `LIMIT ALL` is redundant as it does not limit the number of rows returned.

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Apply this to the subquery to ensure that the filter on `r_name = 'EUROPE'` is evaluated as soon as possible.
2. **Join Elimination**: After reviewing the query, all joins seem necessary for either filtering or selecting required columns.
3. **Use Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert implicit joins to explicit joins for clarity.
4. **Remove Redundant LIMIT**: Remove `LIMIT ALL` from the query.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT s_acctbal, s_name, n_name, p_partkey, p_mfgr, s_address, s_phone, s_comment 
FROM part
JOIN partsupp ON p_partkey = ps_partkey
JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey
WHERE p_size = 16 
  AND p_type LIKE '%NICKEL' 
  AND r_name = 'EUROPE' 
  AND ps_supplycost = (
    SELECT MIN(ps_supplycost) 
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
    JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey
    WHERE p_partkey = ps_partkey 
      AND r_name = 'EUROPE'
  ) 
ORDER BY s_acctbal DESC, n_name, s_name, p_partkey;
```

This optimized query should perform better due to more efficient filtering and clearer join structures.
