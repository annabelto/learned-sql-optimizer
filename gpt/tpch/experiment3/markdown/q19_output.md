### Original Query
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue 
FROM 
    lineitem, part 
WHERE 
    (p_partkey = l_partkey AND p_brand = 'Brand#53' AND p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND l_quantity >= 10 AND l_quantity <= 20 AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5 AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON') 
    OR 
    (p_partkey = l_partkey AND p_brand = 'Brand#32' AND p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND l_quantity >= 13 AND l_quantity <= 23 AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10 AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON') 
    OR 
    (p_partkey = l_partkey AND p_brand = 'Brand#41' AND p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND l_quantity >= 23 AND l_quantity <= 33 AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15 AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON');
```

### Rewrite Rules
1. **Join Decomposition**: Break the query into three separate queries based on the OR conditions and then UNION the results. This will allow the database to optimize each query separately.
2. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the conditions on the part and lineitem tables into the FROM clause using INNER JOIN. This will reduce the number of rows that need to be processed in the WHERE clause.
3. **Use explicit JOIN syntax instead of comma-separated**: This makes the query more readable and easier to optimize.
