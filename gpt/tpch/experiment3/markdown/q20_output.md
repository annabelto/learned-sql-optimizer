The given query is a bit complex and involves multiple subqueries and joins. Let's first create a syntactically correct PostgreSQL query.

### Corrected Query:

```sql
SELECT s_name, s_address 
FROM supplier 
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
WHERE s_suppkey IN (
    SELECT ps_suppkey 
    FROM partsupp 
    JOIN (
        SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, l_suppkey AS agg_suppkey, 0.5 * SUM(l_quantity) AS agg_quantity 
        FROM lineitem 
        WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR 
        GROUP BY l_partkey, l_suppkey
    ) AS agg_lineitem ON agg_partkey = ps_partkey AND agg_suppkey = ps_suppkey 
    WHERE ps_partkey IN (
        SELECT p_partkey 
        FROM part 
        WHERE p_name LIKE 'linen%'
    ) AND ps_availqty > agg_quantity
) AND n_name = 'FRANCE' 
ORDER BY s_name;
```

Now, let's optimize the query. The rules used are:

1. **Join Order Optimization**: Reorder the joins to reduce the size of intermediate results.
2. **Subquery Flattening**: Convert the subquery into a join to avoid multiple scans of the same table.
3. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the conditions as close as possible to their source of data.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT s_name, s_address 
FROM supplier 
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey AND n_name = 'FRANCE'
JOIN (
    SELECT ps_suppkey 
    FROM partsupp 
    JOIN (
        SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, l_suppkey AS agg_suppkey, 0.5 * SUM(l_quantity) AS agg_quantity 
        FROM lineitem 
        WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR 
        GROUP BY l_partkey, l_suppkey
    ) AS agg_lineitem ON agg_partkey = ps_partkey AND agg_suppkey = ps_suppkey AND ps_availqty > agg_quantity
    JOIN part ON ps_partkey = p_partkey AND p_name LIKE 'linen%'
) AS agg_partsupp ON s_suppkey = agg_partsupp.ps_suppkey
ORDER BY s_name;
```

In the optimized query, we have flattened the subqueries into joins and pushed the predicates down to their respective tables. This should improve the performance of the query.
