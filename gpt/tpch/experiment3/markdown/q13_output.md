The given query is already syntactically correct. It is a complex query that first joins the 'customer' and 'orders' tables based on the 'c_custkey' field, then groups the result by 'c_custkey' and counts the number of 'o_orderkey' for each 'c_custkey'. The result of this subquery is then grouped by 'c_count' and the number of unique 'c_count' is counted. The final result is ordered by 'custdist' and 'c_count' in descending order.

### Optimization

1. **Use of Indexes**: If not already done, create indexes on 'c_custkey' in the 'customer' table and 'o_custkey' in the 'orders' table. This will speed up the join operation. Also, an index on 'o_comment' in the 'orders' table can speed up the 'not like' operation.

2. **Avoid 'not like' operation**: The 'not like' operation is expensive. If possible, try to avoid it or replace it with an equivalent operation that is less expensive.

3. **Use of Materialized Views**: If this query is run frequently with different parameters, consider creating a materialized view of the subquery. This will store the result of the subquery and can be refreshed periodically or on demand.

4. **Use of Partitioning**: If the 'orders' table is large, consider partitioning it on 'o_custkey'. This can speed up the join operation.

5. **Use of LIMIT**: The 'LIMIT ALL' clause is redundant and can be removed. If you want to limit the result, specify a number.

### Optimized Query

Assuming that the above suggestions have been implemented, the optimized query would look like this:

```sql
select c_count, count(*) as custdist 
from (
    select c_custkey, count(o_orderkey) 
    from customer 
    inner join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey 
    where o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%' 
    group by c_custkey
) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count) 
group by c_count 
order by custdist desc, c_count desc;
```

Note: The actual optimization may vary depending on the specific data distribution, database configuration, and usage patterns. Always test the performance of the optimized query to ensure it is faster than the original.
