### Original Query
```sql
SELECT ps_partkey, 
       SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS value 
FROM partsupp, supplier, nation 
WHERE ps_suppkey = s_suppkey 
AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
AND n_name = 'FRANCE' 
GROUP BY ps_partkey 
HAVING SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > 
    (SELECT SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000 
     FROM partsupp, supplier, nation 
     WHERE ps_suppkey = s_suppkey 
     AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
     AND n_name = 'FRANCE') 
ORDER BY value DESC 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps
1. **Join Predicate Pushdown**: Move the join conditions to the FROM clause using JOIN ON syntax. This can improve the performance by reducing the number of rows that need to be processed.
2. **Subquery Elimination**: The subquery in the HAVING clause is a constant value for the entire query. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable or a CTE (Common Table Expression) to avoid calculating it for each row.
3. **Use of Indexes**: If not already present, consider creating indexes on `ps_suppkey`, `s_suppkey`, `s_nationkey`, `n_nationkey`, and `n_name` for faster lookups.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH total_value AS (
    SELECT SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000 AS total 
    FROM partsupp 
    JOIN supplier ON partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey 
    JOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey 
    WHERE nation.n_name = 'FRANCE'
)
SELECT ps_partkey, 
       SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS value 
FROM partsupp 
JOIN supplier ON partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey 
JOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey 
WHERE nation.n_name = 'FRANCE' 
GROUP BY ps_partkey 
HAVING SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (SELECT total FROM total_value) 
ORDER BY value DESC;
```
Note: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is removed in the optimized query as it is redundant. By default, PostgreSQL will return all rows if no limit is specified.
