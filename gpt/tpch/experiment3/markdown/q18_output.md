The given query is already syntactically correct. However, it can be optimized by using JOINs instead of subqueries and WHERE clauses for joining tables. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.

### Rewrite Rules Used:

1. Replace subqueries with JOINs: Subqueries can be slower than JOINs, especially in large databases. By replacing the subquery with a JOIN, we can potentially improve the performance of the query.

2. Use explicit JOIN syntax instead of WHERE for joining tables: This makes the query easier to read and understand, and can also improve performance in some cases.

3. Remove unnecessary GROUP BY columns: Only the columns that are used in aggregate functions or that need to be included in the result set need to be included in the GROUP BY clause. Removing unnecessary columns can improve performance.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.c_name, 
    c.c_custkey, 
    o.o_orderkey, 
    o.o_orderdate, 
    o.o_totalprice, 
    SUM(l.l_quantity)
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
JOIN 
    lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
JOIN 
    (
        SELECT 
            l_orderkey, 
            SUM(l_quantity) AS total_quantity
        FROM 
            lineitem
        GROUP BY 
            l_orderkey
        HAVING 
            SUM(l_quantity) > 313
    ) AS subq ON o.o_orderkey = subq.l_orderkey
GROUP BY 
    c.c_name, 
    c.c_custkey, 
    o.o_orderkey, 
    o.o_orderdate, 
    o.o_totalprice
ORDER BY 
    o.o_totalprice DESC, 
    o.o_orderdate;
```

This query should return the same results as the original query, but it should be faster and more efficient.
