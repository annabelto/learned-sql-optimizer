The input query is already syntactically correct. However, it can be optimized for better performance. The query is joining three tables: lineitem, part, and a subquery from lineitem. The join conditions are on l_partkey and p_partkey. The where clause is filtering on p_brand, p_container, and l_quantity.

### Optimization Steps:

1. **Use explicit JOIN syntax**: This makes the query more readable and easier to understand. It also allows for better optimization by the query planner.

2. **Reduce the number of JOINs**: The subquery is unnecessary and can be incorporated into the main query. This reduces the number of JOINs and can significantly improve performance.

3. **Use indexes**: If not already present, consider adding indexes on the columns used in the join conditions and the where clause. This can greatly speed up the query.

4. **Avoid division in aggregate function**: Division is a costly operation. It's better to perform the division after the sum has been calculated.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    (SUM(l.l_extendedprice) / 7.0) AS avg_yearly 
FROM 
    lineitem l
JOIN 
    part p ON p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE 
    p.p_brand = 'Brand#41' 
    AND p.p_container = 'WRAP BAG' 
    AND l.l_quantity < (SELECT 0.2 * AVG(l_quantity) FROM lineitem WHERE l_partkey = p.p_partkey)
```

Note: The LIMIT ALL clause was removed as it doesn't affect the result of the query.
