### Original Query
```sql
SELECT 100.00 * SUM(
    CASE 
        WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) 
        ELSE 0 
    END) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS promo_revenue 
FROM lineitem, part 
WHERE l_partkey = p_partkey 
AND l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-10-01' 
AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-10-01' + INTERVAL '1' month 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Join Optimization**: Instead of using a comma to join the tables, use an explicit JOIN clause. This makes the query more readable and allows the database to optimize the join operation.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the conditions on the `l_shipdate` to the WHERE clause. This allows the database to filter out rows earlier, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.

3. **Use of Indexes**: If indexes on `l_shipdate`, `l_partkey` and `p_partkey` exist, the database can use these to speed up the query. If not, consider creating them.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 100.00 * SUM(
    CASE 
        WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) 
        ELSE 0 
    END) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS promo_revenue 
FROM lineitem 
JOIN part ON lineitem.l_partkey = part.p_partkey 
WHERE lineitem.l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-10-01' 
AND lineitem.l_shipdate < DATE '1995-10-01' + INTERVAL '1' month;
```

Note: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is not necessary and has been removed in the optimized query. It doesn't limit the output and thus doesn't affect the query result.
