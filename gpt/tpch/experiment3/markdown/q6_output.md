The given query is already syntactically correct for PostgreSQL. However, it can be optimized for better performance. Here are the steps to optimize the query:

1. **Indexing**: If not already done, create an index on the `l_shipdate`, `l_discount`, and `l_quantity` columns. This will significantly speed up the query if the `lineitem` table has a large number of rows. However, this is not a rewrite rule, but a database optimization technique.

2. **Use BETWEEN for date range**: The date range condition can be rewritten using the BETWEEN operator, which is more readable and may be more efficient.

3. **Remove unnecessary LIMIT clause**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is unnecessary and can be removed. In PostgreSQL, `LIMIT ALL` is equivalent to omitting the LIMIT clause.

4. **Use a subquery for complex calculations**: The calculation of the revenue can be moved to a subquery. This can make the query more readable and may improve performance if the calculation is complex.

Here is the optimized query:

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT SUM(sub.revenue) as total_revenue
FROM (
  SELECT l_extendedprice * l_discount as revenue
  FROM lineitem
  WHERE l_shipdate BETWEEN date '1995-01-01' AND date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year - interval '1' day
    AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.03 - 0.01 AND 0.03 + 0.01
    AND l_quantity < 25
) sub;
```

In this optimized query, the date range is specified using the BETWEEN operator, the unnecessary LIMIT clause is removed, and the revenue calculation is moved to a subquery.
