The given query is already syntactically correct. However, it can be optimized for better performance. The optimization rules applied are:

1. **Eliminate Subquery**: The subquery in the WHERE clause can be eliminated by using a JOIN operation instead. This can significantly improve the performance of the query.

2. **Use of CTE (Common Table Expressions)**: Instead of creating and dropping a view, we can use a CTE. This will make the query more readable and maintainable.

3. **Use of LIMIT**: The use of LIMIT ALL is redundant and can be removed.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
WITH revenue0 AS (
    SELECT l_suppkey AS supplier_no, 
           SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS total_revenue 
    FROM lineitem 
    WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1996-07-01' 
          AND l_shipdate < DATE '1996-07-01' + INTERVAL '3' MONTH 
    GROUP BY l_suppkey
), max_revenue AS (
    SELECT MAX(total_revenue) AS max_revenue 
    FROM revenue0
)
SELECT s.s_suppkey, 
       s.s_name, 
       s.s_address, 
       s.s_phone, 
       r.total_revenue 
FROM supplier s 
JOIN revenue0 r ON s.s_suppkey = r.supplier_no 
JOIN max_revenue m ON r.total_revenue = m.max_revenue 
ORDER BY s.s_suppkey;
```

This optimized query first calculates the total revenue for each supplier within a specified date range using a CTE named `revenue0`. Then it calculates the maximum revenue using another CTE named `max_revenue`. Finally, it joins the `supplier` table with these two CTEs to get the desired output.
