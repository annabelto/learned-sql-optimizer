The given query is syntactically correct and can be run on a PostgreSQL database. However, it can be optimized for better performance. 

### Optimization Steps:

1. **Join Optimization**: The query uses an old-style comma-separated list of tables. This can be replaced with a proper JOIN clause, which is easier to read and optimize for the database engine.

2. **Indexing**: If not already done, creating indexes on the columns used in the WHERE clause and JOIN condition (o_orderkey, l_orderkey, l_shipmode, l_commitdate, l_shipdate, l_receiptdate) can significantly improve the performance.

3. **Use of BETWEEN for Date Range**: The query uses two conditions to define a date range. This can be replaced with a single BETWEEN condition, which is more readable and can be more efficiently optimized by the database engine.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Conditions**: The condition `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate` is redundant because it's already implied by `l_shipdate < l_commitdate` and `l_receiptdate > l_shipdate`. We can remove this condition.

5. **Use of COUNT instead of SUM**: Instead of using SUM with a CASE statement, we can use COUNT with a WHERE clause in a subquery. This can be more efficient because it avoids the need for a conditional computation for every row.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    l.l_shipmode, 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey AND (o.o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' OR o.o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH')) AS high_line_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey AND o.o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' AND o.o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH') AS low_line_count
FROM 
    lineitem l
JOIN 
    orders o ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
WHERE 
    l.l_shipmode IN ('RAIL', 'TRUCK') 
    AND l.l_shipdate < l.l_commitdate 
    AND l.l_receiptdate BETWEEN date '1995-01-01' AND date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year
GROUP BY 
    l.l_shipmode 
ORDER BY 
    l.l_shipmode;
```

Please note that the actual performance of the optimized query can depend on various factors such as the database schema, the data distribution, the database engine's query optimizer, etc. Therefore, it's always a good idea to test the performance of the optimized query in the actual environment.
