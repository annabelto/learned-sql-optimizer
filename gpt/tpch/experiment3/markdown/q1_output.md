The given query is already optimized and follows the best practices of PostgreSQL. It is using aggregate functions (sum, avg, count), a WHERE clause for filtering, and GROUP BY for grouping the results. It also uses ORDER BY for sorting and LIMIT for limiting the results.

However, there are a few general tips that could be applied to optimize the query further:

1. Indexing: If the table is large, consider creating an index on the `l_shipdate`, `l_returnflag`, and `l_linestatus` columns to speed up the WHERE and ORDER BY operations.

2. Partitioning: If the table is very large, consider partitioning the table on the `l_shipdate` column. This can significantly improve the performance of queries that filter by the `l_shipdate`.

3. Statistics: Keep the statistics up to date. PostgreSQL uses statistics to choose the most efficient query plan. You can update the statistics by running the `ANALYZE` command.

4. Hardware: If the query is still slow after applying the above tips, consider upgrading your hardware. More RAM and faster disks can significantly improve the performance of your database.

### Optimized Query:

The optimized query would remain the same as the original query, assuming the above tips have been applied:

```sql
SELECT 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus, 
    sum(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
    sum(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
    avg(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
    avg(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
    avg(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
    count(*) AS count_order 
FROM 
    lineitem 
WHERE 
    l_shipdate <= date '1998-12-01' - interval '70' day 
GROUP BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
ORDER BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
LIMIT ALL;
```
