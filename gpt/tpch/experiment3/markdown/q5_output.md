### Original Query
```sql
SELECT n_name, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue 
FROM customer, orders, lineitem, supplier, nation, region 
WHERE c_custkey = o_custkey 
AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
AND l_suppkey = s_suppkey 
AND c_nationkey = s_nationkey 
AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
AND n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
AND r_name = 'MIDDLE EAST' 
AND o_orderdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
AND o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR 
GROUP BY n_name 
ORDER BY revenue DESC 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Rewrite Rules Applied
1. **Join Decomposition**: Break down the query into multiple smaller queries using joins. This can help the database optimizer to better understand the query and optimize it.
2. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move the predicates as close as possible to the base tables. This can reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.
3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Instead of using the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause, use explicit JOIN syntax. This can make the query easier to understand and optimize.
4. **Removal of LIMIT ALL**: LIMIT ALL is equivalent to not having a LIMIT clause at all, so it can be removed.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT n_name, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue 
FROM customer 
JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey 
JOIN lineitem ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
JOIN supplier ON l_suppkey = s_suppkey AND c_nationkey = s_nationkey 
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
WHERE r_name = 'MIDDLE EAST' 
AND o_orderdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
AND o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR 
GROUP BY n_name 
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```
