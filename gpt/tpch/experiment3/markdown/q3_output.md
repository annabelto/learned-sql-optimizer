### Original Query
```sql
SELECT 
    l_orderkey, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue, 
    o_orderdate, 
    o_shippriority 
FROM 
    customer, 
    orders, 
    lineitem 
WHERE 
    c_mktsegment = 'AUTOMOBILE' 
    AND c_custkey = o_custkey 
    AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
    AND o_orderdate < DATE '1995-03-20' 
    AND l_shipdate > DATE '1995-03-20' 
GROUP BY 
    l_orderkey, 
    o_orderdate, 
    o_shippriority 
ORDER BY 
    revenue DESC, 
    o_orderdate 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Join Optimization**: Replace the implicit joins with explicit joins. This can improve the performance of the query by allowing the database to better understand the relationships between the tables.

2. **Filtering Early**: Move the conditions related to a single table to a subquery. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the main query.

3. **Indexing**: Not a rewrite rule, but creating indexes on the columns used in the join conditions and WHERE clause can significantly improve the performance of the query. This is assuming that the database doesn't already have these indexes.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    l.l_orderkey, 
    SUM(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount)) AS revenue, 
    o.o_orderdate, 
    o.o_shippriority 
FROM 
    (SELECT * FROM customer WHERE c_mktsegment = 'AUTOMOBILE') c
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.c_custkey AND o.o_orderdate < DATE '1995-03-20'
JOIN 
    (SELECT * FROM lineitem WHERE l_shipdate > DATE '1995-03-20') l ON l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
GROUP BY 
    l.l_orderkey, 
    o.o_orderdate, 
    o.o_shippriority 
ORDER BY 
    revenue DESC, 
    o.o_orderdate;
```
Note: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is not necessary and has been removed in the optimized query.
