### Original Query
```sql
SELECT cntrycode, COUNT(*) AS numcust, SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal 
FROM (
    SELECT substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode, c_acctbal 
    FROM customer 
    WHERE substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29') 
    AND c_acctbal > (
        SELECT AVG(c_acctbal) 
        FROM customer 
        WHERE c_acctbal > 0.00 
        AND substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
    ) 
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT * 
        FROM orders 
        WHERE o_custkey = c_custkey
    )
) AS custsale 
GROUP BY cntrycode 
ORDER BY cntrycode 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Rewrite Rules
1. **Subquery Materialization**: The subquery that calculates the average account balance is executed for each row in the customer table. This is inefficient and can be improved by calculating the average once and storing it in a variable or a temporary table.
2. **Redundant Condition Elimination**: The condition `c_acctbal > 0.00` in the subquery is redundant because the outer query already filters out customers with account balance less than the average.
3. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: The expression `substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2)` is repeated multiple times in the query. We can calculate it once and reuse the result.
4. **Join Elimination**: The `NOT EXISTS` subquery can be replaced with a `LEFT JOIN` and a `NULL` check, which can be more efficient if the `orders` table has an index on `o_custkey`.

### Optimized Query
```sql
WITH avg_acctbal AS (
    SELECT AVG(c_acctbal) AS avg 
    FROM customer 
    WHERE substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
), 
cust AS (
    SELECT substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode, c_acctbal, c_custkey 
    FROM customer 
    WHERE substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
), 
custsale AS (
    SELECT cntrycode, c_acctbal 
    FROM cust 
    LEFT JOIN orders ON cust.c_custkey = orders.o_custkey 
    WHERE orders.o_custkey IS NULL 
    AND c_acctbal > (SELECT avg FROM avg_acctbal)
)
SELECT cntrycode, COUNT(*) AS numcust, SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal 
FROM custsale 
GROUP BY cntrycode 
ORDER BY cntrycode;
```
