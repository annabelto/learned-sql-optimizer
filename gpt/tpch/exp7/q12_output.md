To optimize the given TPC-H query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select l_shipmode, 
       sum(case when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' then 1 else 0 end) as high_line_count, 
       sum(case when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' then 1 else 0 end) as low_line_count 
from orders, lineitem 
where o_orderkey = l_orderkey 
      and l_shipmode in ('RAIL', 'TRUCK') 
      and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate 
      and l_shipdate < l_commitdate 
      and l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01' 
      and l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year 
group by l_shipmode 
order by l_shipmode 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
select l_shipmode, 
       sum(case when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' then 1 else 0 end) as high_line_count, 
       sum(case when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' then 1 else 0 end) as low_line_count 
from orders 
join lineitem 
  on o_orderkey = l_orderkey 
  and l_shipmode in ('RAIL', 'TRUCK') 
  and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate 
  and l_shipdate < l_commitdate 
  and l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01' 
  and l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year 
group by l_shipmode 
order by l_shipmode 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** Replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with an explicit JOIN clause, specifying the join condition using the ON keyword. This clarifies the relationship between the tables and the specific conditions under which they are joined.
- **Rule 6:** Moved all relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the JOIN. This helps in potentially reducing the dataset early during the join process rather than filtering after a Cartesian product has been formed, which can improve performance.

This rewritten query now uses explicit JOIN syntax and conditions, making it clearer and potentially more efficient depending on the database's query execution planner and the underlying data distribution.
