To optimize the given query, we will apply several of the provided data-independent rewrite rules. The original query uses subqueries and conditions effectively, but we can enhance readability and potentially improve execution by using explicit join syntax and moving conditions appropriately.

### Rules Applied:
1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select cntrycode, count(*) as numcust, sum(c_acctbal) as totacctbal 
from (
    select substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) as cntrycode, c_acctbal 
    from customer 
    where substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29') 
    and c_acctbal > (
        select avg(c_acctbal) 
        from customer 
        where c_acctbal > 0.00 
        and substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
    ) 
    and not exists (
        select * 
        from orders 
        where o_custkey = c_custkey
    )
) as custsale 
group by cntrycode 
order by cntrycode 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT cntrycode, COUNT(*) AS numcust, SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal
FROM (
    SELECT substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode, c_acctbal
    FROM customer
    LEFT JOIN orders ON customer.c_custkey = orders.o_custkey
    WHERE substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
      AND c_acctbal > (
          SELECT AVG(c_acctbal)
          FROM customer
          WHERE c_acctbal > 0.00
            AND substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
      )
      AND orders.o_custkey IS NULL
) AS custsale
GROUP BY cntrycode
ORDER BY cntrycode
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:
- **Explicit Join Syntax**: The `LEFT JOIN` is used to replace the `NOT EXISTS` subquery. This makes the relationship between `customer` and `orders` explicit and leverages the join condition to filter out customers who have orders.
- **Conditions Moved to ON Clause**: The condition `o_custkey IS NULL` is used to ensure that we only consider customers without orders, effectively replacing the `NOT EXISTS` subquery.
- **Maintained Subquery for Aggregate Condition**: The condition involving the average account balance is kept within a subquery in the `WHERE` clause because it depends on an aggregate function which cannot be directly moved to a `JOIN` condition.

This rewritten query should be more readable and might also benefit from performance improvements due to the explicit use of joins and clearer structure.
