The provided query is already quite optimized in terms of its structure for the operations it performs. It does not involve multiple tables or joins, so many of the provided rules about rewriting joins do not directly apply. However, we can still review the query to ensure it follows best practices and is clear in its intentions.

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.03 - 0.01 AND 0.03 + 0.01
  AND l_quantity < 25
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Analysis and Optimization Steps
1. **Clarify the `BETWEEN` Clause**: The `BETWEEN` clause for `l_discount` uses arithmetic directly within the clause, which might be confusing at first glance. It's clearer to calculate these values beforehand or comment them for clarity, but since this is a simple arithmetic, it's acceptable as is.

2. **Use of `LIMIT ALL`**: The `LIMIT ALL` is effectively redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. It can be removed without changing the query's functionality.

3. **Formatting and Readability**: While not affecting performance, improving the readability of the query can help in maintenance and understanding. Properly formatting and optionally commenting complex parts of the query can be beneficial.

### Optimized Query
Since the query does not involve joins or multiple tables, and the conditions are specific and necessary for the intended filtering, the main optimization here is the removal of `LIMIT ALL` for clarity and conciseness.

```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.03 - 0.01 AND 0.03 + 0.01
  AND l_quantity < 25;
```

### Summary of Applied Rules
- **Rule Applied**: Removal of unnecessary clauses (specifically `LIMIT ALL`).
- **Order of Application**: This was the only modification needed, so it was the first and only rule applied.

This optimized query should perform the same as the original but is slightly cleaner by removing the unnecessary `LIMIT ALL` clause.
