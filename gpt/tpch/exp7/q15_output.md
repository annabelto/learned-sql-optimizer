To optimize the given query, we will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
3. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.
4. Use explicit join conditions.

### Optimized Query

```sql
-- Create a view to hold the revenue calculations
CREATE VIEW revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) AS 
SELECT l_suppkey, SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1996-07-01' 
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1996-07-01' + INTERVAL '3' month
GROUP BY l_suppkey;

-- Main query using explicit JOIN syntax and moving conditions to ON clause
SELECT s.s_suppkey, s.s_name, s.s_address, s.s_phone, r.total_revenue
FROM supplier s
JOIN revenue0 r ON s.s_suppkey = r.supplier_no
WHERE r.total_revenue = (
    SELECT MAX(total_revenue) FROM revenue0
)
ORDER BY s.s_suppkey
LIMIT ALL;

-- Drop the view after use
DROP VIEW revenue0;
```

Explanation:
- **Rule 1 and Rule 2**: The original query used a comma-separated list of tables (`supplier, revenue0`) in the `FROM` clause and linked them using the `WHERE` clause. This has been replaced with an explicit `JOIN` syntax (`JOIN revenue0 r ON s.s_suppkey = r.supplier_no`), which is clearer and more modern.
- **Rule 3**: The condition linking `supplier` and `revenue0` (`s_suppkey = supplier_no`) has been moved to the `ON` clause of the `JOIN`, which is the recommended place for join conditions as it can help improve readability and potentially the performance of the query.
- **Rule 4**: The join condition is explicitly stated in the `ON` clause, making the relationship between the tables clear.

This rewritten query maintains the same logic and output as the original but uses a more modern, readable, and potentially efficient SQL syntax.
