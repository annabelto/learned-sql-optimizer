To optimize the provided query, I will apply several of the data-independent rewrite rules listed. The original query uses implicit joins and conditions in the WHERE clause to link multiple tables, which can be rewritten using explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potentially better performance. Here's the step-by-step application of the rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly
FROM part
JOIN lineitem ON part.p_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey
JOIN (
    SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 0.2 * AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_partkey
) part_agg ON lineitem.l_partkey = part_agg.agg_partkey
WHERE part.p_brand = 'Brand#41'
  AND part.p_container = 'WRAP BAG'
  AND lineitem.l_quantity < part_agg.avg_quantity
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The original query used comma-separated table names in the `FROM` clause. I replaced this with explicit `JOIN` clauses to clearly define how the tables are related.
- **Moving Conditions to ON Clause**: Conditions that were originally in the `WHERE` clause linking `part` and `lineitem` tables, and `lineitem` with `part_agg`, have been moved to the respective `ON` clauses of the `JOIN` statements. This helps in potentially reducing the number of rows combined before filtering.
- **Maintaining WHERE Conditions**: Conditions specific to filtering results based on attributes of the `part` table (`p_brand` and `p_container`) and a comparison condition (`l_quantity < avg_quantity`) remain in the `WHERE` clause, as they are used to filter the result after the joins are made.

This rewritten query is clearer in terms of understanding the relationships between tables and the logic of data filtering, which can also assist the database optimizer in executing the query more efficiently.
