To optimize the provided TPC-H query, I will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules in the specified order:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    c_custkey, 
    c_name, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue, 
    c_acctbal, 
    n_name, 
    c_address, 
    c_phone, 
    c_comment 
FROM 
    customer
JOIN 
    orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey
JOIN 
    lineitem ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey
JOIN 
    nation ON c_nationkey = n_nationkey
WHERE 
    o_orderdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
    AND o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' MONTH 
    AND l_returnflag = 'R'
GROUP BY 
    c_custkey, 
    c_name, 
    c_acctbal, 
    c_phone, 
    n_name, 
    c_address, 
    c_comment 
ORDER BY 
    revenue DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Rule 1 & 2:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax.
- **Rule 3 & 4:** I used explicit JOIN conditions to link the tables logically based on their relationships.
- **Rule 5:** The join conditions are explicitly stated in the ON clauses of the JOINs.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the conditions that logically belong to specific table relationships from the WHERE clause to the respective ON clauses in the JOINs. However, in this case, the conditions related to `o_orderdate` and `l_returnflag` remain in the WHERE clause as they filter rows post-joining rather than dictate the join itself.

This rewritten query is more readable and maintains clear separation between joining logic and filtering logic, which can help in understanding and maintaining the query. Additionally, explicit JOIN syntax is generally preferred for clarity and potential performance benefits in some SQL engines.
