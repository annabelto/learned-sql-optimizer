To optimize the given TPC-H query, we will apply the following data-independent rewrite rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

However, in this specific query, there are no joins present, and the query is primarily focused on aggregation and filtering on a single table (`lineitem`). Therefore, rules related to joins (1-6) are not applicable directly. The query can be optimized by ensuring that the filtering and aggregation are expressed clearly, but the structure of the query itself is already optimal for its purpose since it involves operations on a single table.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus, 
    SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
    AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
    AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
    AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
    COUNT(*) AS count_order 
FROM 
    lineitem 
WHERE 
    l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '70' DAY 
GROUP BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
ORDER BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
LIMIT ALL;
```

This query is already optimized for its purpose as it uses efficient aggregation functions and a WHERE clause for filtering. The use of explicit GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses ensures that the database engine can optimize the execution plan for aggregation and sorting. The LIMIT ALL clause is effectively redundant as it does not limit the number of rows returned, but it has been retained as specified in the original query.
