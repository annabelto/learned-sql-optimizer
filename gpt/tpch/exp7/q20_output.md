To optimize the provided query, I will apply the rules listed in the order that makes the query more readable and potentially more efficient by using explicit JOIN syntax and moving conditions to appropriate places. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select s_name, s_address 
from supplier, nation 
where s_suppkey in (
    select ps_suppkey 
    from partsupp, (
        select l_partkey agg_partkey, l_suppkey agg_suppkey, 0.5 * sum(l_quantity) AS agg_quantity 
        from lineitem 
        where l_shipdate >= date '1995-01-01' and l_shipdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year 
        group by l_partkey, l_suppkey
    ) agg_lineitem 
    where agg_partkey = ps_partkey and agg_suppkey = ps_suppkey 
    and ps_partkey in (
        select p_partkey 
        from part 
        where p_name like 'linen%'
    ) 
    and ps_availqty > agg_quantity
) 
and s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
and n_name = 'FRANCE' 
order by s_name 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT s_name, s_address 
FROM supplier
JOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey
WHERE supplier.s_suppkey IN (
    SELECT partsupp.ps_suppkey
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN (
        SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, l_suppkey AS agg_suppkey, 0.5 * SUM(l_quantity) AS agg_quantity
        FROM lineitem
        WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' year
        GROUP BY l_partkey, l_suppkey
    ) AS agg_lineitem ON partsupp.ps_partkey = agg_lineitem.agg_partkey AND partsupp.ps_suppkey = agg_lineitem.agg_suppkey
    WHERE partsupp.ps_partkey IN (
        SELECT p_partkey
        FROM part
        WHERE p_name LIKE 'linen%'
    )
    AND partsupp.ps_availqty > agg_lineitem.agg_quantity
)
AND nation.n_name = 'FRANCE'
ORDER BY s_name
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1-6**: I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax and moved the join conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the JOINs. This makes the query more readable and aligns with modern SQL practices. The subqueries were also adjusted to use explicit JOINs where applicable. Conditions that are specific to filtering results within subqueries remain in the WHERE clause of those subqueries.
