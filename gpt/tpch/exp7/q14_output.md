To optimize the given query, I will apply the following rules:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select 100.00 * sum(case when p_type like 'PROMO%' then l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) else 0 end) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue 
from lineitem, part 
where l_partkey = p_partkey 
and l_shipdate >= date '1995-10-01' 
and l_shipdate < date '1995-10-01' + interval '1' month 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 100.00 * SUM(CASE WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) ELSE 0 END) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS promo_revenue 
FROM lineitem 
JOIN part ON lineitem.l_partkey = part.p_partkey 
WHERE lineitem.l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-10-01' 
AND lineitem.l_shipdate < DATE '1995-10-01' + INTERVAL '1' month 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Rule 1 & 2**: I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with an explicit JOIN syntax (`FROM lineitem JOIN part ON lineitem.l_partkey = part.p_partkey`). This makes the relationship between the tables clearer and is generally preferred for readability and maintainability.
   
2. **Rule 3 & 5**: The condition linking the two tables (`l_partkey = p_partkey`) was moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the JOIN. This is not only a best practice for clarity but can also help the database optimizer by reducing the dataset early during query processing.

3. **Rule 4**: All conditions that are not directly related to the JOIN condition but rather filter the data are kept in the WHERE clause. This maintains the logical separation between joining tables and filtering rows.

By applying these rules, the query becomes more readable and potentially allows the database engine to optimize the join operation more effectively.
