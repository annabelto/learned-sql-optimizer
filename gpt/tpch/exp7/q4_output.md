To optimize the given query, we will apply several of the provided rewrite rules to improve its readability and potentially its execution plan. The original query uses a subquery with an EXISTS clause, which is appropriate, but we can enhance the clarity and explicitness of the joins.

### Original Query
```sql
select o_orderpriority, count(*) as order_count
from orders
where o_orderdate >= date '1996-01-01'
  and o_orderdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '3' month
  and exists (
    select * from lineitem
    where l_orderkey = o_orderkey
      and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
  )
group by o_orderpriority
order by o_orderpriority
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimization Steps

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
   - Not applicable here as there are no comma-separated tables.

2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
   - Not applicable as there are no implicit joins.

3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
   - We will convert the EXISTS subquery to a JOIN, although this changes semantics slightly, it should be functionally equivalent given the use of DISTINCT to ensure counts remain correct.

4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
   - Similar to the above, we will use a JOIN to combine `orders` and `lineitem`.

5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
   - We will specify the join condition explicitly in the ON clause.

6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**
   - We will move relevant conditions from the WHERE clause of the subquery to the ON clause of the JOIN.

### Optimized Query
```sql
select o_orderpriority, count(distinct orders.o_orderkey) as order_count
from orders
join lineitem on lineitem.l_orderkey = orders.o_orderkey
  and lineitem.l_commitdate < lineitem.l_receiptdate
where orders.o_orderdate >= date '1996-01-01'
  and orders.o_orderdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '3' month
group by o_orderpriority
order by o_orderpriority
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes
- Converted the EXISTS subquery into an explicit JOIN. This makes the relationship between `orders` and `lineitem` clearer and allows us to move the condition `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate` directly into the JOIN clause.
- Used `count(distinct orders.o_orderkey)` in the SELECT clause to ensure that the count remains accurate after converting from an EXISTS subquery to a JOIN. This is necessary because JOINs can produce multiple rows per `orders` entry if multiple `lineitem` entries match, whereas the EXISTS subquery inherently does not duplicate `orders` entries.
- Moved the condition `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate` from the WHERE clause of the subquery to the ON clause of the JOIN, making the join condition explicit and potentially allowing for more efficient execution plans.

This rewritten query should be functionally equivalent to the original while being clearer and potentially more efficient due to better use of joins.
