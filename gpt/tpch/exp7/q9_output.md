To optimize the given query, I will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    nation, 
    o_year, 
    SUM(amount) AS sum_profit 
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            n_name AS nation, 
            EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) AS o_year, 
            l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity AS amount 
        FROM 
            part
            JOIN partsupp ON p_partkey = ps_partkey
            JOIN lineitem ON ps_partkey = l_partkey AND ps_suppkey = l_suppkey AND l_partkey = p_partkey
            JOIN orders ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
            JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = l_suppkey
            JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
        WHERE 
            p_name LIKE '%white%'
    ) AS profit 
GROUP BY 
    nation, 
    o_year 
ORDER BY 
    nation, 
    o_year DESC 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**: I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOINs. Each JOIN is accompanied by an ON clause that specifies the join condition, which was previously in the WHERE clause. This makes the query easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Rule 6**: I moved all relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clauses of the respective JOINs. This can help improve performance by reducing the number of rows combined in the joins before filtering in the WHERE clause.

3. **General**: The query now uses explicit JOIN syntax, which is generally preferred for clarity and potential performance benefits in complex queries. The WHERE clause now only contains the condition related to the 'part' table, which cannot be moved to an ON clause as it does not involve a join condition but rather a filter on the rows of a single table.
