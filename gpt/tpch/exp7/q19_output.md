To optimize the provided query, I will apply several of the suggested rewrite rules to improve its readability and potentially its execution plan. The rules I will use are:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Original Query:
```sql
select sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from lineitem, part
where (p_partkey = l_partkey and p_brand = 'Brand#53' and p_container in ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')
       and l_quantity >= 10 and l_quantity <= 20 and p_size between 1 and 5
       and l_shipmode in ('AIR', 'AIR REG') and l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')
   or (p_partkey = l_partkey and p_brand = 'Brand#32' and p_container in ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
       and l_quantity >= 13 and l_quantity <= 23 and p_size between 1 and 10
       and l_shipmode in ('AIR', 'AIR REG') and l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')
   or (p_partkey = l_partkey and p_brand = 'Brand#41' and p_container in ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')
       and l_quantity >= 23 and l_quantity <= 33 and p_size between 1 and 15
       and l_shipmode in ('AIR', 'AIR REG') and l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM part
JOIN lineitem ON part.p_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey
WHERE (part.p_brand = 'Brand#53' AND part.p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')
       AND lineitem.l_quantity BETWEEN 10 AND 20 AND part.p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5
       AND lineitem.l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND lineitem.l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')
   OR (part.p_brand = 'Brand#32' AND part.p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
       AND lineitem.l_quantity BETWEEN 13 AND 23 AND part.p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10
       AND lineitem.l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND lineitem.l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')
   OR (part.p_brand = 'Brand#41' AND part.p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')
       AND lineitem.l_quantity BETWEEN 23 AND 33 AND part.p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15
       AND lineitem.l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND lineitem.l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON')
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** I replaced the comma-separated table list in the FROM clause with an explicit JOIN clause, specifying the join condition directly in the ON clause.
- **Rule 6:** I moved the join condition (`p_partkey = l_partkey`) from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the JOIN, which is more appropriate for specifying how tables are linked.
- The conditions within the WHERE clause are grouped logically according to the brand and other attributes, maintaining the original logic but using explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potential performance improvement.
