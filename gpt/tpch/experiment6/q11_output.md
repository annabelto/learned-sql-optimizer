To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can help improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the number of rows processed early in the execution plan.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and eliminate any sub-expressions (subqueries or calculations) that are repeated and compute them once.
3. **Join Elimination**: If a table in a join operation does not contribute to the final result other than through a filtering condition, and if that condition can be satisfied elsewhere, the join and the table can sometimes be eliminated.
4. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Convert implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control over join behavior.

### Original Query:
```sql
select ps_partkey, sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) as value
from partsupp, supplier, nation
where ps_suppkey = s_suppkey and s_nationkey = n_nationkey and n_name = 'FRANCE'
group by ps_partkey
having sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (
    select sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000
    from partsupp, supplier, nation
    where ps_suppkey = s_suppkey and s_nationkey = n_nationkey and n_name = 'FRANCE'
)
order by value desc
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We push the condition `n_name = 'FRANCE'` closer to the table `nation` in the joins.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: The subquery in the HAVING clause is computed for every group unnecessarily. We can compute it once and use the result.
3. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Convert the query to use explicit JOIN syntax.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH france_parts AS (
    SELECT ps_partkey, ps_suppkey, ps_supplycost, ps_availqty
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN supplier ON ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
    JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    WHERE n_name = 'FRANCE'
),
total_value AS (
    SELECT sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000 AS threshold
    FROM france_parts
)
SELECT ps_partkey, sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) as value
FROM france_parts
GROUP BY ps_partkey
HAVING sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (SELECT threshold FROM total_value)
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:
- **WITH Clauses**: `france_parts` collects all relevant rows that match the condition `n_name = 'FRANCE'` across the `partsupp`, `supplier`, and `nation` tables. `total_value` computes the threshold value once.
- **Explicit JOINs**: The query now uses explicit JOINs, which are generally more readable and can be more efficient depending on the database's query optimizer.
- **HAVING Clause**: Now uses the precomputed threshold from the `total_value` CTE, avoiding repeated computation for each group.

This rewritten query should perform better due to reduced computation and more efficient data handling.
