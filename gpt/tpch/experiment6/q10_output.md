To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without changing the semantics of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (conditions) closer to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed in the early stages of the query, which can significantly decrease the amount of data that needs to be handled in later stages.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to reduce the size of intermediate results. It's beneficial to join smaller tables or the results of highly filtered tables early.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This improves readability and often helps the database optimizer understand the query better compared to implicit joins (comma-separated FROM clauses).

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    c.c_custkey, 
    c.c_name, 
    SUM(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount)) AS revenue, 
    c.c_acctbal, 
    n.n_name, 
    c.c_address, 
    c.c_phone, 
    c.c_comment 
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
JOIN 
    lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
JOIN 
    nation n ON c.c_nationkey = n.n_nationkey
WHERE 
    o.o_orderdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
    AND o.o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' MONTH
    AND l.l_returnflag = 'R'
GROUP BY 
    c.c_custkey, 
    c.c_name, 
    c.c_acctbal, 
    c.c_phone, 
    n.n_name, 
    c.c_address, 
    c.c_comment 
ORDER BY 
    revenue DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `o_orderdate` and `l_returnflag` are pushed down in the query, directly in the WHERE clause, which helps in filtering out unnecessary rows early in the query execution.

2. **Join Reordering**: Although the original query does not specify the join order, using explicit JOIN syntax and ensuring that smaller or more restrictive datasets (like filtered orders and lineitems) are joined earlier can help in reducing the processing load.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query now uses explicit JOIN clauses (INNER JOIN) instead of commas in the FROM clause. This not only makes the query more readable but also often leads to better execution plans as it is clearer which tables are being joined on which conditions.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time of the query by minimizing the amount of data being processed and clarifying the join conditions for the database's query optimizer.
