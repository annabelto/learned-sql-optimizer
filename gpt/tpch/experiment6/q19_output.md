To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules include predicate pushdown, simplification of expressions, and the use of explicit joins instead of implicit joins. Here's the step-by-step application of these rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. This can reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution plan, which can significantly improve performance.

2. **Simplification of Expressions**: The range conditions on `l_quantity` can be simplified. For example, `l_quantity >= 10 and l_quantity <= 10 + 10` can be simplified to `l_quantity between 10 and 20`.

3. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Changing from implicit joins (using commas in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can make the query easier to understand and optimize for the query planner.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM part
JOIN lineitem ON p_partkey = l_partkey
WHERE 
    (
        p_brand = 'Brand#53' AND
        p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND
        l_quantity BETWEEN 10 AND 20 AND
        p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5 AND
        l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND
        l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
    ) OR (
        p_brand = 'Brand#32' AND
        p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND
        l_quantity BETWEEN 13 AND 23 AND
        p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10 AND
        l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND
        l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
    ) OR (
        p_brand = 'Brand#41' AND
        p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND
        l_quantity BETWEEN 23 AND 33 AND
        p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15 AND
        l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND
        l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
    )
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions related to `part` and `lineitem` tables are pushed down to the respective tables as much as possible.
- **Simplification of Expressions**: The range checks for `l_quantity` are simplified using the `BETWEEN` keyword.
- **Use of Explicit Joins**: The query now uses explicit `JOIN` syntax, which is generally preferred for clarity and can help the database optimizer.

These changes should help in improving the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data scanned and processed, and by making better use of indexes if available.
