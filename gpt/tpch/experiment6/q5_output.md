To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the semantics of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates (conditions) as close as possible to the base tables in the query. This reduces the number of rows early in the execution plan, which can significantly decrease the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages.

2. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to start with those that reduce the result set the most, based on available statistics and the predicates applied. This can help in reducing the size of intermediate results and thus speed up the query.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert implicit joins (using commas in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax. This improves readability and can help the database optimizer understand the query structure better, potentially leading to a better execution plan.

### Original Query:
```sql
select n_name, sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from customer, orders, lineitem, supplier, nation, region
where c_custkey = o_custkey
  and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
  and l_suppkey = s_suppkey
  and c_nationkey = s_nationkey
  and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
  and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
  and r_name = 'MIDDLE EAST'
  and o_orderdate >= date '1995-01-01'
  and o_orderdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by n_name
order by revenue desc
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying Predicate Pushdown:
Move the conditions related to `orders` and `region` closer to those tables.

### Applying Join Reordering:
Reorder joins to filter by `region` and `orders` first, as these tables are filtered by specific conditions that can greatly reduce the number of rows.

### Applying Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax:
Convert the query to use explicit JOINs.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT n_name, SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM region
JOIN nation ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey
JOIN supplier ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
JOIN customer ON c_nationkey = s_nationkey
JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey
  AND o_orderdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' year
JOIN lineitem ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey
  AND l_suppkey = s_suppkey
WHERE r_name = 'MIDDLE EAST'
GROUP BY n_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

This rewritten query uses explicit JOINs to clarify the relationships between tables, applies predicate pushdown to reduce the number of rows processed early in the query, and reorders joins to potentially utilize indexes and reduce intermediate result sizes.
