To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. The rules I will use include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed early in the execution plan, which can significantly improve performance.

2. **Join Elimination**: If the join condition and the where clause guarantee that every row from one table matches exactly one row from another, and if only columns from one table are selected, the join might be unnecessary.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (from the WHERE clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it makes the join conditions clearer and more manageable for the query planner.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Operations**: In this case, `LIMIT ALL` is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it simplifies the query.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We push the conditions on `l_shipdate` directly into the join condition. This reduces the number of rows that need to be joined.

2. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert the implicit join to an explicit INNER JOIN for clarity.

3. **Elimination of Redundant Operations**: Remove `LIMIT ALL` as it serves no purpose.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 100.00 * SUM(
    CASE 
        WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) 
        ELSE 0 
    END
) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS promo_revenue
FROM lineitem
INNER JOIN part ON lineitem.l_partkey = part.p_partkey
WHERE lineitem.l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-10-01'
AND lineitem.l_shipdate < DATE '1995-10-01' + INTERVAL '1 month';
```

### Explanation:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `l_shipdate` are included in the WHERE clause, which is evaluated before the join operation. This reduces the number of rows from `lineitem` that need to be considered in the join.
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query now clearly shows an INNER JOIN between `lineitem` and `part`, making the join conditions explicit.
- **Elimination of Redundant Operations**: `LIMIT ALL` has been removed, simplifying the query without affecting its functionality.

These changes should make the query more efficient and easier to understand, potentially improving execution time by reducing the amount of data processed and clearly defining join conditions.
