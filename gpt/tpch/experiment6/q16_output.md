To optimize the given PostgreSQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, reduce the amount of data processed, and improve execution efficiency without altering the output. Here are the rules I will apply:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the number of rows processed early in the execution plan.
2. **Use of JOINs instead of IN with a subquery**: Convert the subquery with `NOT IN` to a `LEFT JOIN` and check for NULLs, which can be more efficient in execution.
3. **Elimination of Redundant Expressions**: Simplify or remove any redundant conditions or expressions to streamline the query.

### Original Query:
```sql
select p_brand, p_type, p_size, count(distinct ps_suppkey) as supplier_cnt 
from partsupp, part 
where p_partkey = ps_partkey 
  and p_brand <> 'Brand#24' 
  and p_type not like 'STANDARD BURNISHED%' 
  and p_size in (44, 6, 46, 36, 42, 17, 26, 18) 
  and ps_suppkey not in ( 
    select s_suppkey 
    from supplier 
    where s_comment like '%Customer%Complaints%' 
  ) 
group by p_brand, p_type, p_size 
order by supplier_cnt desc, p_brand, p_type, p_size 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Step-by-Step Optimization:

#### 1. Predicate Pushdown:
Move the conditions on `p_brand`, `p_type`, and `p_size` directly into the join condition to reduce the number of rows joined.

#### 2. Use of JOINs instead of IN with a subquery:
Convert the `NOT IN` subquery into a `LEFT JOIN` and check for NULLs in the `ps_suppkey` to filter out the unwanted rows.

#### 3. Elimination of Redundant Expressions:
The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant as it does not limit the number of rows and can be removed for clarity.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT p.p_brand, p.p_type, p.p_size, COUNT(DISTINCT ps.ps_suppkey) AS supplier_cnt
FROM part p
JOIN partsupp ps ON p.p_partkey = ps.ps_partkey
LEFT JOIN supplier s ON ps.ps_suppkey = s.s_suppkey AND s.s_comment LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
WHERE p.p_brand <> 'Brand#24'
  AND p.p_type NOT LIKE 'STANDARD BURNISHED%'
  AND p.p_size IN (44, 6, 46, 36, 42, 17, 26, 18)
  AND s.s_suppkey IS NULL
GROUP BY p.p_brand, p.p_type, p.p_size
ORDER BY supplier_cnt DESC, p.p_brand, p.p_type, p.p_size;
```

This rewritten query uses joins more effectively, reduces the number of rows processed by pushing predicates closer to the data source, and removes the redundant `LIMIT ALL` clause. These changes should help in achieving better performance.
