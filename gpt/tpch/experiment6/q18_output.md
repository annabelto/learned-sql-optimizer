To optimize the provided TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, improve its readability, and potentially enhance execution performance by restructuring joins, subqueries, and other elements. Here are the steps and rules I will apply:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move conditions as close as possible to where the data originates. This can reduce the amount of data processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Use of Explicit JOINs**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and understanding.
3. **Elimination of Redundant GROUP BY**: Analyze if all elements in the GROUP BY are necessary or if they can be inferred from unique constraints.
4. **Subquery to Join Transformation**: Convert subqueries that are used in an IN clause to a JOIN if it can reduce the complexity and improve performance.

### Original Query:
```sql
select c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice, sum(l_quantity)
from customer, orders, lineitem
where o_orderkey in (
    select l_orderkey
    from lineitem
    group by l_orderkey
    having sum(l_quantity) > 313
)
and c_custkey = o_custkey
and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
group by c_name, c_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice
order by o_totalprice desc, o_orderdate
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying the Rewrite Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We push the condition `sum(l_quantity) > 313` directly into the subquery and closer to the `lineitem` table scan.
2. **Use of Explicit JOINs**: Convert the implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.
3. **Subquery to Join Transformation**: Convert the subquery used in the IN clause to a JOIN.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT c.c_name, c.c_custkey, o.o_orderkey, o.o_orderdate, o.o_totalprice, SUM(l.l_quantity)
FROM customer c
JOIN orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
JOIN (
    SELECT l_orderkey
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_orderkey
    HAVING SUM(l_quantity) > 313
) AS sub_l ON l.l_orderkey = sub_l.l_orderkey
GROUP BY c.c_name, c.c_custkey, o.o_orderkey, o.o_orderdate, o.o_totalprice
ORDER BY o.o_totalprice DESC, o.o_orderdate
LIMIT ALL;
```

In this optimized query:
- We use explicit JOINs to clarify how tables are connected.
- We transformed the subquery into a JOIN, which might be more efficient depending on the database's query planner and the underlying data distribution.
- We maintained all original GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses as they are necessary for the correct aggregation and sorting of the results.
