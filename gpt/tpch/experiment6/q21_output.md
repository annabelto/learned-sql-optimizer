To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without changing the semantics of the query. Here are the rules I will apply:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates closer to the data sources. This reduces the number of rows processed in the joins by filtering data earlier.
2. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to reduce the size of intermediate results, which can decrease the overall query execution time.
3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated tables) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control over join execution.
4. **Elimination of Redundant Subqueries**: Analyze and simplify subqueries to avoid unnecessary operations.

### Original Query Analysis
The original query involves multiple tables (`supplier`, `lineitem`, `orders`, `nation`) and has complex conditions including subqueries checking for the existence of certain conditions in the `lineitem` table.

### Applying Rewrite Rules

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
- Move the condition `o_orderstatus = 'F'` directly into the join condition with `orders`.
- Move the condition `n_name = 'KENYA'` directly into the join condition with `nation`.

#### Step 2: Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax
- Convert the implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity.

#### Step 3: Join Reordering
- Since `nation` and `supplier` are filtered by direct conditions, join these first to reduce the dataset early in the query processing.

#### Step 4: Elimination of Redundant Subqueries
- The subqueries are essential for the logic of counting suppliers based on specific conditions in `lineitem`, so they remain unchanged.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT s_name, COUNT(*) AS numwait
FROM nation
JOIN supplier ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
JOIN lineitem l1 ON s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey
JOIN orders ON o_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey AND o_orderstatus = 'F'
WHERE n_name = 'KENYA'
  AND l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM lineitem l2
    WHERE l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
      AND l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
  )
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM lineitem l3
    WHERE l3.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
      AND l3.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
      AND l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate
  )
GROUP BY s_name
ORDER BY numwait DESC, s_name
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation
- **Explicit JOINs** are used for clarity and to specify join conditions directly.
- **Predicate pushdown** is applied to filter rows as early as possible in the query execution.
- **Join reordering** is used to start with the smallest possible dataset by joining `nation` and `supplier` first based on direct filtering conditions.
- The **subqueries** remain to enforce the business logic but are simplified to return `1` instead of `*` for slight performance improvement in checking existence.
