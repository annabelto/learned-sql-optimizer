To optimize the given PostgreSQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving predicates (conditions) closer to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed in the later stages of the query, which can significantly improve performance.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute additional columns or affects the result, it can be eliminated to simplify the query.

3. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Changing implicit joins (using commas in the FROM clause) to explicit joins (using JOIN keyword) can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it makes the join conditions clearer and allows the database engine to optimize better.

4. **Column Pruning**: Removing unnecessary columns from SELECT and JOIN clauses can reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.

### Analysis of the Query:

The original query joins three tables (`lineitem`, `part`, and a derived table `part_agg`) and filters on `p_brand`, `p_container`, and a condition involving `l_quantity` and `avg_quantity`. The derived table `part_agg` computes an average quantity for each part.

### Applying Rewrite Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We can push the conditions on `p_brand` and `p_container` directly into the subquery that selects from the `part` table. This reduces the number of rows joined with `lineitem` and `part_agg`.

2. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Convert the implicit joins to explicit joins to clarify the join conditions and potentially allow the optimizer to work more effectively.

3. **Column Pruning**: Ensure that only necessary columns are selected in the subquery and main query.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT SUM(l.l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly
FROM lineitem l
JOIN part p ON p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
JOIN (
    SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 0.2 * AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_partkey
) part_agg ON part_agg.agg_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE p.p_brand = 'Brand#41'
AND p.p_container = 'WRAP BAG'
AND l.l_quantity < part_agg.avg_quantity
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Explicit Joins**: Changed the query to use explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and potential optimization.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Although the original query does not allow pushing down `p_brand` and `p_container` directly into the subquery due to the structure, ensuring these conditions are evaluated early in the join sequence can help.
- **Column Pruning**: The query only selects the columns necessary for the final output and conditions.

These changes should help in optimizing the execution of the query by reducing the amount of data processed and clarifying the join conditions for the database's query optimizer.
