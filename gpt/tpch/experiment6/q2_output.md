To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the semantics of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the number of rows processed in the later stages of the query.
2. **Join Reordering**: Reorder joins to reduce the size of intermediate results, which can decrease query execution time.
3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Replace implicit joins (comma-separated tables) with explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and control over join execution.
4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Remove columns from SELECT and JOIN clauses that are not needed for the final output or subsequent operations.
5. **Subquery Optimization**: Convert the correlated subquery to a more efficient form if possible.

### Original Query:
```sql
select s_acctbal, s_name, n_name, p_partkey, p_mfgr, s_address, s_phone, s_comment
from part, supplier, partsupp, nation, region
where p_partkey = ps_partkey
and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
and p_size = 16
and p_type like '%NICKEL'
and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
and r_name = 'EUROPE'
and ps_supplycost = (
    select min(ps_supplycost)
    from partsupp, supplier, nation, region
    where p_partkey = ps_partkey
    and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
    and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
    and r_name = 'EUROPE'
)
order by s_acctbal desc, n_name, s_name, p_partkey
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying the Rewrite Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move `p_size = 16` and `p_type like '%NICKEL'` directly after the FROM clause for `part`.
2. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Convert the query to use explicit JOINs.
3. **Join Reordering**: Start with smaller tables or those with more restrictive conditions.
4. **Subquery Optimization**: Pre-calculate the minimum supply cost in a derived table and join it.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT s_acctbal, s_name, n_name, p_partkey, p_mfgr, s_address, s_phone, s_comment
FROM part
JOIN partsupp ON part.p_partkey = partsupp.ps_partkey
JOIN (
    SELECT ps_partkey, min(ps_supplycost) as min_supplycost
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN supplier ON partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey
    JOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey
    JOIN region ON nation.n_regionkey = region.r_regionkey
    WHERE region.r_name = 'EUROPE'
    GROUP BY ps_partkey
) AS min_cost ON partsupp.ps_partkey = min_cost.ps_partkey AND partsupp.ps_supplycost = min_cost.min_supplycost
JOIN supplier ON partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey
JOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey
JOIN region ON nation.n_regionkey = region.r_regionkey
WHERE part.p_size = 16
AND part.p_type LIKE '%NICKEL'
AND region.r_name = 'EUROPE'
ORDER BY s_acctbal DESC, n_name, s_name, p_partkey
LIMIT ALL;
```

This rewritten query uses explicit JOINs for clarity, applies predicate pushdown to reduce the number of rows processed early, and optimizes the subquery by pre-calculating the minimum supply cost.
