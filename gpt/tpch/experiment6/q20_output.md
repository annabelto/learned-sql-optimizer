To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, reduce the amount of data processed, and improve execution efficiency without altering the result. Here are the rules I will apply:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates closer to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed in the subqueries and joins by applying filters as early as possible.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, and if the filtering can be achieved through a subquery or a simpler condition, the join can be eliminated.

3. **Subquery Flattening**: Converts subqueries into joins when possible, which can be more efficiently executed by the database engine.

4. **Use of EXISTS instead of IN**: When checking for existence, EXISTS can be more efficient than IN because it stops processing as soon as a match is found.

### Original Query Analysis:
The original query involves multiple joins and subqueries. The innermost subquery calculates a sum of quantities from the `lineitem` table and filters on `l_shipdate`. The next level checks for parts from `partsupp` that match the conditions from `lineitem` and `part`. Finally, it filters suppliers based on the results of these nested queries and the `nation` table.

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Apply date filters directly in the subquery to reduce the size of intermediate results.
2. **Subquery Flattening**: The subquery that selects from `part` where `p_name like 'linen%'` can be joined directly with `partsupp` to reduce the depth of subqueries.
3. **Use of EXISTS instead of IN**: Replace the IN clause with an EXISTS clause for checking existence in `partsupp`.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT s_name, s_address 
FROM supplier
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
WHERE n_name = 'FRANCE'
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN (
        SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, l_suppkey AS agg_suppkey, 0.5 * SUM(l_quantity) AS agg_quantity
        FROM lineitem
        WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' year
        GROUP BY l_partkey, l_suppkey
    ) agg_lineitem ON agg_lineitem.agg_partkey = partsupp.ps_partkey AND agg_lineitem.agg_suppkey = partsupp.ps_suppkey
    JOIN part ON partsupp.ps_partkey = part.p_partkey
    WHERE part.p_name LIKE 'linen%' AND partsupp.ps_availqty > agg_lineitem.agg_quantity
)
ORDER BY s_name
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The date filter is applied directly in the `lineitem` subquery.
- **Subquery Flattening**: The `part` table is joined directly with `partsupp`, reducing the depth of nested subqueries.
- **Use of EXISTS**: The `EXISTS` clause is used to check for the existence of matching rows in `partsupp`, which can be more efficient than using `IN`.

This rewritten query should perform better due to reduced data processing and simpler execution plans.
