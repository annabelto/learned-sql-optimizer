To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, improve its readability, and potentially enhance execution by the PostgreSQL query planner. Here are the steps and rules I will apply:

1. **Constant Folding**: Simplify arithmetic expressions and constants.
2. **Predicate Simplification**: Simplify and clarify the range checks and conditions.
3. **Eliminate Redundant Clauses**: Remove unnecessary clauses like `LIMIT ALL`.

### Original Query:
```sql
select sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) as revenue
from lineitem
where l_shipdate >= date '1995-01-01'
  and l_shipdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year
  and l_discount between 0.03 - 0.01 and 0.03 + 0.01
  and l_quantity < 25
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying Rewrite Rules:

1. **Constant Folding**:
   - Simplify `date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year` to `date '1996-01-01'`.
   - Simplify `0.03 - 0.01` to `0.02` and `0.03 + 0.01` to `0.04`.

2. **Predicate Simplification**:
   - The `between` clause for `l_discount` can be rewritten for clarity.

3. **Eliminate Redundant Clauses**:
   - `LIMIT ALL` effectively means no limit, so it can be removed as it does not alter the result.

### Rewritten Steps:

- Replace `date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year` with `date '1996-01-01'`.
- Replace `0.03 - 0.01` with `0.02` and `0.03 + 0.01` with `0.04`.
- Remove `LIMIT ALL`.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
select sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) as revenue
from lineitem
where l_shipdate >= date '1995-01-01'
  and l_shipdate < date '1996-01-01'
  and l_discount between 0.02 and 0.04
  and l_quantity < 25;
```

This rewritten query is simpler and clearer, which might help the PostgreSQL query planner to optimize execution. The removal of `LIMIT ALL` and the simplification of constants and predicates contribute to this improvement.
