To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without changing the semantics of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Move predicates as close as possible to where the data originates. This reduces the amount of data processed in the upper layers of the query.
2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: Identify and compute common expressions once, reusing the result, to avoid redundant calculations.
3. **Join Elimination**: Remove unnecessary joins if the join keys are guaranteed to be unique and not used elsewhere.

### Original Query Analysis:
The original query filters customers based on their phone country code and account balance, and checks if they have no corresponding orders. It also computes an average account balance for a subset of customers and uses this average to further filter the customers.

### Applying Rewrite Rules:

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
We can push the condition on `c_acctbal` and `c_phone` directly into the subquery where `c_acctbal` is used. This reduces the amount of data fetched and processed in the outer query parts.

#### Step 2: Common Sub-expression Elimination
The subquery calculating the average account balance (`avg(c_acctbal)`) is used as a filter and is recalculated for each customer unnecessarily. We can calculate this average once and use it in the main query.

#### Step 3: Join Elimination
The `NOT EXISTS` clause with the `orders` table checks if there are no orders for the customer. Since this is a straightforward existence check and does not involve fetching data from the `orders` table, we keep this as is.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
WITH filtered_customers AS (
    SELECT c_custkey, c_acctbal, substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) as cntrycode
    FROM customer
    WHERE substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
),
avg_acctbal AS (
    SELECT avg(c_acctbal) as avg_balance
    FROM filtered_customers
    WHERE c_acctbal > 0.00
)
SELECT cntrycode, count(*) as numcust, sum(c_acctbal) as totacctbal
FROM filtered_customers
WHERE c_acctbal > (SELECT avg_balance FROM avg_acctbal)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE o_custkey = filtered_customers.c_custkey
)
GROUP BY cntrycode
ORDER BY cntrycode
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:
- **filtered_customers**: This CTE pre-filters customers based on their phone country code, reducing the dataset size early.
- **avg_acctbal**: This CTE calculates the average account balance once for all relevant customers, avoiding repeated calculations.
- The main query then uses these CTEs to perform final filtering and aggregation, ensuring that only necessary data is processed in the final steps.
