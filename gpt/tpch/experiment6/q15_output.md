To optimize the given PostgreSQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **View Merging**: Instead of creating a view and then querying that view, we can merge the view definition into the main query. This can reduce overhead and potentially allow for more optimizations.

3. **Eliminate Redundant Sorting**: The `ORDER BY` clause with `LIMIT ALL` is redundant because `LIMIT ALL` implies all rows will be returned, and thus sorting can be avoided unless explicitly required for output ordering.

4. **Use of JOINs**: Replace the implicit join (comma-separated FROM clause) with explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

5. **Subquery to Join**: Convert the correlated subquery used for filtering on `total_revenue` to a join, which can be more efficient in execution.

### Optimized Query

```sql
-- Using CTEs for clarity and potential performance improvement
WITH revenue0 AS (
    SELECT 
        l_suppkey AS supplier_no, 
        SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS total_revenue
    FROM 
        lineitem
    WHERE 
        l_shipdate >= DATE '1996-07-01' AND 
        l_shipdate < DATE '1996-07-01' + INTERVAL '3 months'
    GROUP BY 
        l_suppkey
),
max_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        MAX(total_revenue) AS max_total_revenue
    FROM 
        revenue0
)
SELECT 
    s.s_suppkey, 
    s.s_name, 
    s.s_address, 
    s.s_phone, 
    r.total_revenue
FROM 
    supplier s
JOIN 
    revenue0 r ON s.s_suppkey = r.supplier_no
JOIN 
    max_revenue mr ON r.total_revenue = mr.max_total_revenue
ORDER BY 
    s.s_suppkey;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Used for `revenue0` and `max_revenue` to clearly define temporary result sets.
- **Explicit JOINs**: Used to replace the implicit joins for better readability and potentially more efficient execution plans.
- **Subquery to Join**: The subquery for getting the maximum revenue is converted into a CTE, which is then joined to filter the main query results.
- **Removed `LIMIT ALL`**: Since it is redundant to sort and then apply `LIMIT ALL` (which does not limit the number of rows), it was removed to potentially avoid unnecessary sorting overhead.

This rewritten query should be more efficient and clearer in intent than the original version.
