To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (conditions in the WHERE clause) closer to the data sources. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the size of intermediate results and thus the cost of subsequent operations.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to minimize the size of intermediate results. Typically, it's beneficial to perform more selective joins (those that filter out more rows) earlier.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This improves readability and often allows the database engine to better understand the join conditions and optimize accordingly.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**: Select only the columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in join conditions and filtering.

### Original Query Analysis:
The original query joins three tables: `customer`, `orders`, and `lineitem`, and filters on several conditions. It also calculates a sum of `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` grouped by `l_orderkey`, `o_orderdate`, and `o_shippriority`, and orders the results by `revenue` in descending order and `o_orderdate`.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   - Move `c_mktsegment = 'AUTOMOBILE'` closer to the `customer` table.
   - Move `o_orderdate < date '1995-03-20'` closer to the `orders` table.
   - Move `l_shipdate > date '1995-03-20'` closer to the `lineitem` table.

2. **Join Reordering**:
   - Since `customer` and `orders` are filtered by highly selective conditions, join these first before joining with `lineitem`.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**:
   - Convert implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

4. **Elimination of Redundant Columns**:
   - Ensure only necessary columns are fetched in the SELECT clause.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT
    l.l_orderkey,
    SUM(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount)) AS revenue,
    o.o_orderdate,
    o.o_shippriority
FROM
    customer c
JOIN
    orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
JOIN
    lineitem l ON l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
WHERE
    c.c_mktsegment = 'AUTOMOBILE'
    AND o.o_orderdate < DATE '1995-03-20'
    AND l.l_shipdate > DATE '1995-03-20'
GROUP BY
    l.l_orderkey, o.o_orderdate, o.o_shippriority
ORDER BY
    revenue DESC, o.o_orderdate
LIMIT ALL;
```

This rewritten query uses explicit JOINs, applies filters early, and reorders joins for potentially better performance. The use of explicit JOIN syntax also helps in understanding the relationships between tables more clearly.
