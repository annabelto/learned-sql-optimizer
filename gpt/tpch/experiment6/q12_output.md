To optimize the given PostgreSQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed in the early stages of the query, which can significantly improve performance.

2. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it makes the join conditions more explicit and easier to optimize for the query planner.

3. **Elimination of Redundant Expressions**: Simplifying or removing unnecessary parts of the query that do not affect the result.

4. **Column Pruning**: Selecting only the necessary columns in the subqueries or joins to reduce the amount of data processed.

Here's how these rules can be applied to the given query:

### Original Query:
```sql
select l_shipmode,
       sum(case when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' then 1 else 0 end) as high_line_count,
       sum(case when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' then 1 else 0 end) as low_line_count
from orders, lineitem
where o_orderkey = l_orderkey
  and l_shipmode in ('RAIL', 'TRUCK')
  and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
  and l_shipdate < l_commitdate
  and l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01'
  and l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by l_shipmode
order by l_shipmode
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying Rewrite Rules:

1. **Use of Explicit Joins**:
   Convert the implicit join to an explicit `INNER JOIN` for clarity and potential performance benefits.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   Move the conditions related to `lineitem` closer to where `lineitem` is first mentioned.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT l_shipmode,
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority IN ('1-URGENT', '2-HIGH') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_line_count,
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority NOT IN ('1-URGENT', '2-HIGH') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS low_line_count
FROM orders
JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
WHERE l_shipmode IN ('RAIL', 'TRUCK')
  AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
  AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate
  AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND l_receiptdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1 year'
GROUP BY l_shipmode
ORDER BY l_shipmode
LIMIT ALL;
```

**Explanation**:
- **Explicit Joins**: The query now uses `JOIN` to explicitly state the join condition.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions related to `lineitem` are placed immediately after the table is mentioned, which can help the optimizer.
- **Simplification of Expressions**: The `CASE` statements have been simplified using `IN` and `NOT IN` for clarity and potentially better performance.

This rewritten query should be more efficient and clearer in intent than the original query.
