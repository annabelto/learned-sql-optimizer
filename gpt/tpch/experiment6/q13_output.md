To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, reduce the amount of data processed, and potentially improve execution performance. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule involves moving predicates (conditions) closer to the data source. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the size of the intermediate result sets, which can decrease the overall query execution time.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Grouping Operations**: If there are any unnecessary grouping operations, they should be removed or simplified to avoid extra computational overhead.

3. **Use of Efficient Joins**: Ensuring that the join conditions are optimal and that the most restrictive filters are applied early in the join conditions.

4. **Limit Pushdown**: If there's a LIMIT clause, pushing this operation closer to the data retrieval stage can reduce the amount of data processed.

### Original Query Analysis:
```sql
select c_count, count(*) as custdist
from (
    select c_custkey, count(o_orderkey)
    from customer
    left outer join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
    group by c_custkey
) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by c_count
order by custdist desc, c_count desc
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: The condition `o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'` is already pushed down in the join condition, which is optimal.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Grouping Operations**: The inner query groups by `c_custkey` to count `o_orderkey`, which is necessary for calculating `c_count`. The outer query groups by `c_count` to calculate `custdist`. Both grouping operations are essential and cannot be eliminated.

3. **Use of Efficient Joins**: The join condition is already using an efficient method by combining the key join with a filter on `o_comment`. This is optimal as it reduces the size of the joined table by filtering out unwanted rows early.

4. **Limit Pushdown**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is effectively redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. It can be removed to simplify the query.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
select c_count, count(*) as custdist
from (
    select c_custkey, count(o_orderkey)
    from customer
    left outer join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
    group by c_custkey
) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by c_count
order by custdist desc, c_count desc;
```

In this case, the main optimization was the removal of the redundant `LIMIT ALL` clause. The other aspects of the query were already optimized given the constraints and requirements of the query.
