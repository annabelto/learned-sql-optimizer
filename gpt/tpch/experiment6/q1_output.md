To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that focus on improving the performance without changing the semantics of the query. Here are the rules I will use and the order in which I will apply them:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule involves moving the predicates (filters) as close as possible to the data source. In this query, the predicate on `l_shipdate` is already at the base table, so no action is needed here.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Limit**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause in SQL is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing this clause can simplify the query plan.

3. **Use of Approximate Aggregates**: If exact precision is not crucial, using approximate functions for aggregates like `count` can improve performance. However, this might not be applicable if exact results are required, as is typical in TPC-H benchmarks.

4. **Column Pruning**: Ensure that only the columns needed for the final output or conditions are selected in the query. In this case, all columns used in calculations and conditions are necessary, so no columns can be pruned.

5. **Reordering of Group By and Order By Clauses**: Since the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses use the same columns, no additional sorting is required. This is already optimized.

After applying these rules, the main change is the removal of the `LIMIT ALL` clause. The query does not need further optimization in terms of join elimination, subquery flattening, or other transformations since it is a straightforward aggregation query without subqueries or joins.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus, 
    SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
    AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
    AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
    AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
    COUNT(*) AS count_order 
FROM 
    lineitem 
WHERE 
    l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '70' DAY 
GROUP BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
ORDER BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus;
```

This optimized query removes the unnecessary `LIMIT ALL` clause and maintains all other aspects of the original query, ensuring that performance is not compromised by redundant operations.
