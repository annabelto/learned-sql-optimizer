To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. This can reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution plan, which can significantly improve performance.

2. **Use of JOIN Instead of EXISTS**: Replacing the EXISTS clause with an INNER JOIN can sometimes be more efficient, especially if the database can utilize indexes effectively. This is because JOIN operations are generally well-optimized in modern RDBMS systems.

3. **Elimination of Redundant LIMIT**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it simplifies the query.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT o_orderpriority, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
JOIN lineitem ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey
WHERE o_orderdate >= DATE '1996-01-01'
  AND o_orderdate < DATE '1996-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' month
  AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
GROUP BY o_orderpriority
ORDER BY o_orderpriority;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `o_orderdate` are directly related to the `orders` table and are kept in the WHERE clause. The condition from the EXISTS subquery (`l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`) is moved to the main WHERE clause to reduce the number of rows joined.

2. **Use of JOIN Instead of EXISTS**: The EXISTS subquery is replaced with an INNER JOIN on `lineitem` using `l_orderkey = o_orderkey`. This allows the database to potentially use indexes on `l_orderkey` and `o_orderkey` for faster join operations.

3. **Elimination of Redundant LIMIT**: Removed `LIMIT ALL` as it serves no purpose in limiting the result set.

These changes should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and utilizing joins and indexes more effectively.
