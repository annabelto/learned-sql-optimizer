### Optimized Query

The original query provided is already quite optimized in terms of its structure for the operations it performs. However, we can apply some of the rules provided to make the SQL syntax clearer and more aligned with best practices. The original query does not involve multiple tables or joins, so many of the rules related to joins are not applicable directly. However, I will format the query using best practices for clarity and maintainability:

```sql
SELECT 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus, 
    SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
    AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
    AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
    AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
    COUNT(*) AS count_order 
FROM 
    lineitem 
WHERE 
    l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '70 day' 
GROUP BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
ORDER BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Applied Rules and Order:

1. **Formatting and Clarity**: Although not explicitly listed in the rules, improving the readability and maintainability of SQL queries is a fundamental aspect of optimization in terms of long-term code management and review. This includes proper indentation, use of line breaks, and capitalization of SQL keywords.

2. **Explicit SELECT Clauses**: The SELECT clause was already explicit about the fields and calculations it needed.

3. **WHERE Clause Usage**: The WHERE clause is used appropriately to filter records before grouping, which is optimal for performance as it reduces the number of rows to process in the GROUP BY stage.

4. **GROUP BY and ORDER BY Clauses**: These clauses are used correctly to aggregate data and then order the result set. The fields used in ORDER BY are the same as those in GROUP BY, which is a good practice for predictable sorting of aggregated results.

5. **LIMIT ALL**: This is effectively the same as omitting the LIMIT clause because it does not limit the number of rows returned. It's included here explicitly as per the original query, but could be omitted for simplicity.

Since the original query does not involve multiple tables or JOIN operations, rules related to JOINs (rules 1-5 about explicit join syntax and moving conditions to ON clauses) are not applicable. The optimization here primarily focuses on query clarity and maintaining the existing logical structure for performance.
