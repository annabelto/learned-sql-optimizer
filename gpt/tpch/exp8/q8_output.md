To optimize the given TPC-H query, I will apply the provided data-independent rewrite rules in a logical sequence to improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select o_year, sum(case when nation = 'MOZAMBIQUE' then volume else 0 end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share 
from (
    select extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year, 
           l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume, 
           n2.n_name as nation 
    from part, supplier, lineitem, orders, customer, nation n1, nation n2, region 
    where p_partkey = l_partkey 
      and s_suppkey = l_suppkey 
      and l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
      and o_custkey = c_custkey 
      and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey 
      and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
      and r_name = 'AFRICA' 
      and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey 
      and o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31' 
      and p_type = 'PROMO BRUSHED BRASS'
) as all_nations 
group by o_year 
order by o_year 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT o_year, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN nation = 'MOZAMBIQUE' THEN volume ELSE 0 END) / SUM(volume) AS mkt_share 
FROM (
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) AS o_year, 
           l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) AS volume, 
           n2.n_name AS nation 
    FROM part 
    JOIN lineitem ON p_partkey = l_partkey 
    JOIN orders ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
    JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = l_suppkey 
    JOIN customer ON o_custkey = c_custkey 
    JOIN nation n1 ON c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey 
    JOIN region ON n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
    JOIN nation n2 ON s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey 
    WHERE r_name = 'AFRICA' 
      AND o_orderdate BETWEEN DATE '1995-01-01' AND DATE '1996-12-31' 
      AND p_type = 'PROMO BRUSHED BRASS'
) AS all_nations 
GROUP BY o_year 
ORDER BY o_year 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1-4**: I replaced the comma-separated list of tables with explicit `JOIN` clauses, specifying the join conditions using the `ON` keyword.
- **Step 5**: I ensured that all join conditions are explicitly stated in the `ON` clauses.
- **Step 6**: I moved all relevant conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clauses where appropriate, except for the filters that do not directly relate to the join conditions (like `r_name`, `o_orderdate`, and `p_type`).

This rewritten query should be easier to read and maintain, and it might also benefit from better execution plans generated by the PostgreSQL query optimizer.
