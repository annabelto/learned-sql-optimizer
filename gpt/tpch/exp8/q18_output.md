To further optimize the query, I will focus on simplifying the execution and reducing the overhead introduced by complex joins and subqueries. The goal is to streamline the query execution by minimizing unnecessary operations and ensuring efficient use of indexes. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. **Simplify the subquery**: Instead of using a subquery in the WHERE clause, integrate it directly into the JOIN condition to reduce the complexity and potentially allow for better use of indexes.
2. **Optimize join conditions**: Ensure that join conditions are straightforward and allow for index usage.
3. **Reduce the number of grouped columns if possible**: This can sometimes reduce the complexity of the GROUP BY operation.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    c.c_name, 
    c.c_custkey, 
    o.o_orderkey, 
    o.o_orderdate, 
    o.o_totalprice, 
    SUM(l.l_quantity)
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
JOIN 
    lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
WHERE 
    l.l_orderkey IN (
        SELECT 
            l_orderkey 
        FROM 
            lineitem 
        GROUP BY 
            l_orderkey 
        HAVING 
            SUM(l_quantity) > 313
    )
GROUP BY 
    c.c_name, 
    c.c_custkey, 
    o.o_orderkey, 
    o.o_orderdate, 
    o.o_totalprice
ORDER BY 
    o.o_totalprice DESC, 
    o.o_orderdate
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** The subquery is used directly in the WHERE clause to filter `lineitem` entries. This approach is reverted to closely match the original query's logic but with explicit JOIN syntax, which might help in some optimizer scenarios.
- **Step 2:** The join conditions are kept straightforward and explicit, ensuring that the database can effectively use indexes on `c_custkey`, `o_custkey`, and `o_orderkey`.
- **Step 3:** The GROUP BY clause remains comprehensive to maintain the integrity of the aggregation operation.

This version of the query aims to balance between explicit join syntax and maintaining a structure close to the original query, which seemed to perform relatively well. The use of explicit JOINs and a direct subquery in the WHERE clause is intended to optimize the execution path while keeping the query logic intact.
