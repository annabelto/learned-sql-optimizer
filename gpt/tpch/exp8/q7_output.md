To optimize the given TPC-H query, I will apply the provided data-independent rewrite rules in a logical sequence to improve the readability and potentially the performance of the query. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year, SUM(volume) AS revenue
FROM (
    SELECT 
        n1.n_name AS supp_nation, 
        n2.n_name AS cust_nation, 
        EXTRACT(year FROM l_shipdate) AS l_year, 
        l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) AS volume
    FROM 
        supplier
        JOIN lineitem ON s_suppkey = l_suppkey
        JOIN orders ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
        JOIN customer ON c_custkey = o_custkey
        JOIN nation n1 ON s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
        JOIN nation n2 ON c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
    WHERE 
        ((n1.n_name = 'CANADA' AND n2.n_name = 'MOZAMBIQUE') OR 
         (n1.n_name = 'MOZAMBIQUE' AND n2.n_name = 'CANADA'))
        AND l_shipdate BETWEEN DATE '1995-01-01' AND DATE '1996-12-31'
) AS shipping
GROUP BY supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year
ORDER BY supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Step 1 & 2:** I replaced the comma-separated list of tables in the FROM clause with explicit JOIN syntax.
- **Step 3 & 4:** I used explicit JOIN conditions instead of linking tables in the WHERE clause. This makes the query easier to understand and maintain.
- **Step 5:** I ensured that all join conditions are explicitly stated in the JOIN ON clauses.
- **Step 6:** I moved relevant conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clauses where appropriate. However, in this case, the filtering conditions based on nation names and ship dates are more appropriately left in the WHERE clause, as they are not directly related to how the tables are joined but rather to how the data is filtered post-join.

This rewritten query should be easier to read and maintain, and it might also benefit from performance improvements depending on the database's query optimizer.
