To further optimize the query for better performance, we can consider additional strategies such as:

1. **Using EXISTS instead of NOT IN for subqueries**: This can be more efficient as EXISTS will stop processing as soon as it finds the first occurrence, unlike NOT IN which needs to check all records.
2. **Indexing**: Ensure that there are appropriate indexes on the columns used in joins and where clauses. For this example, I'll assume that indexes might be beneficial on `p_partkey`, `ps_suppkey`, and `s_suppkey`.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT p_brand, p_type, p_size, COUNT(DISTINCT ps_suppkey) AS supplier_cnt
FROM partsupp
JOIN part ON p_partkey = ps_partkey
WHERE p_brand <> 'Brand#24'
  AND p_type NOT LIKE 'STANDARD BURNISHED%'
  AND p_size IN (44, 6, 46, 36, 42, 17, 26, 18)
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM supplier
    WHERE s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
      AND s_comment LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
  )
GROUP BY p_brand, p_type, p_size
ORDER BY supplier_cnt DESC, p_brand, p_type, p_size
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Using EXISTS instead of NOT IN**: Replaced the `NOT IN` subquery with an `EXISTS` subquery. This change can lead to performance improvements because `EXISTS` will return true as soon as it finds a match, making it faster in scenarios where matches are likely to exist.

### Additional Recommendations:
- **Indexing**: If not already present, consider adding indexes on `part.p_partkey`, `partsupp.ps_partkey`, `partsupp.ps_suppkey`, and `supplier.s_suppkey`. Also, an index on `supplier.s_comment` might help, but be cautious as it can be expensive to maintain due to the nature of the data type and content.
- **Analyze and Vacuum**: Regular maintenance like running ANALYZE and VACUUM can help PostgreSQL optimize query plans based on the most recent data statistics.

These changes and recommendations aim to improve the execution time of the query by optimizing how the data is accessed and processed.
