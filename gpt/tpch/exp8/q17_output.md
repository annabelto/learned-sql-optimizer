To optimize the provided query, I will apply several of the data-independent rewrite rules listed. The original query uses implicit joins and conditions in the WHERE clause to link multiple tables, which can be rewritten using explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and potentially improved performance by clearly defining join conditions. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**
2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**
3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**
4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**
5. **Use explicit join conditions.**
6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**

### Original Query:
```sql
select sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 as avg_yearly 
from lineitem, part, 
     (SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 0.2 * avg(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity 
      FROM lineitem 
      GROUP BY l_partkey) part_agg 
where p_partkey = l_partkey 
  and agg_partkey = l_partkey 
  and p_brand = 'Brand#41' 
  and p_container = 'WRAP BAG' 
  and l_quantity < avg_quantity 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly
FROM part
JOIN lineitem ON part.p_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey
JOIN (
    SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 0.2 * AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_partkey
) part_agg ON lineitem.l_partkey = part_agg.agg_partkey
WHERE part.p_brand = 'Brand#41'
  AND part.p_container = 'WRAP BAG'
  AND lineitem.l_quantity < part_agg.avg_quantity
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The tables `lineitem`, `part`, and the subquery `part_agg` are joined using explicit `JOIN` clauses instead of being listed in the `FROM` clause separated by commas.
- **Explicit Join Conditions**: The conditions `p_partkey = l_partkey` and `agg_partkey = l_partkey` are moved to the respective `ON` clauses of the `JOIN` statements.
- **Conditions Moved to ON Clause**: The join conditions are explicitly stated in the `ON` clauses, making the logical relationships between tables clearer.
- **Filter Conditions in WHERE Clause**: The conditions related to `p_brand`, `p_container`, and `l_quantity` are kept in the `WHERE` clause as they are filters post-joining the tables.

This rewritten query should be easier to understand and maintain, and it might also benefit from performance improvements depending on how PostgreSQL's query planner optimizes JOINs compared to WHERE filters.
