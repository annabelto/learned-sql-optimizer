Given the challenges in improving the performance beyond the original query's execution time, let's focus on refining the approach to optimize the subqueries and ensure efficient execution without altering the logic of the original query. We will attempt to optimize the average calculation by caching its result and ensuring efficient filtering.

### Optimized Query

```sql
-- Calculate the average account balance for customers with positive balances in specified countries
WITH AvgBalance AS (
    SELECT AVG(c_acctbal) AS avg_acctbal
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_acctbal > 0.00
      AND SUBSTRING(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
)

-- Main query to select country code, count of customers, and total account balance
SELECT 
    SUBSTRING(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode, 
    COUNT(*) AS numcust, 
    SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal
FROM 
    customer
WHERE 
    SUBSTRING(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
    AND c_acctbal > (SELECT avg_acctbal FROM AvgBalance)
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM orders
        WHERE o_custkey = customer.c_custkey
    )
GROUP BY 
    SUBSTRING(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2)
ORDER BY 
    SUBSTRING(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2)
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **CTE for Average Calculation**: The average account balance is calculated once in a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `AvgBalance`. This CTE computes the average account balance for customers with positive balances from the specified countries. This approach avoids recalculating the average for each row in the main query, potentially reducing computational overhead.
- **Direct Use of CTE in Main Query**: The main query directly uses the result from the `AvgBalance` CTE to compare each customer's account balance against the precomputed average. This should be more efficient than recalculating the average for each customer.
- **Optimized EXISTS Clause**: The `EXISTS` clause continues to use `SELECT 1` instead of `SELECT *`, minimizing the data processed during the existence check.
- **Simplified Grouping**: The grouping is done directly by the substring of the phone number, which simplifies the query and ensures that the grouping matches the selection criteria.

### Additional Recommendations:
- **Indexing**: Ensure that there are indexes on `customer(c_phone, c_acctbal, c_custkey)` and `orders(o_custkey)`. These indexes can significantly improve the performance of the query by speeding up the filtering and join operations.
- **Analyze and Vacuum**: Regularly run `ANALYZE` and `VACUUM` on the database to maintain statistics and optimize query planning.
- **Review Execution Plan**: Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to review the execution plan of the query. This can provide insights into how PostgreSQL is executing the query and whether any specific parts of the query are causing performance issues.

This approach aims to optimize the computation of averages and reduce redundant calculations, potentially improving the overall performance of the query.
