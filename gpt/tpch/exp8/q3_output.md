To further optimize the query for performance, we need to consider additional aspects such as the selectivity of the conditions and the order of joins based on the size of the filtered datasets. Here, I will attempt to reorder the joins and conditions to potentially leverage more efficient execution plans, especially focusing on reducing the size of intermediate results early in the query execution.

### Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    l_orderkey, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue, 
    o_orderdate, 
    o_shippriority 
FROM 
    customer 
JOIN 
    orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey AND o_orderdate < DATE '1995-03-20'
JOIN 
    lineitem ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey AND l_shipdate > DATE '1995-03-20'
WHERE 
    c_mktsegment = 'AUTOMOBILE'
GROUP BY 
    l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority 
ORDER BY 
    revenue DESC, o_orderdate 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Condition Placement**: I moved the conditions `o_orderdate < DATE '1995-03-20'` and `l_shipdate > DATE '1995-03-20'` to the respective `ON` clauses of the joins. This change aims to reduce the size of the datasets being joined by filtering rows earlier in the query process, which can potentially reduce the computational load during the join operations.

2. **Join Order**: The order of joins remains the same, but with the added filters in the join conditions, the database engine might be able to more efficiently manage and minimize the size of intermediate datasets.

3. **Filtering Early**: By applying date filters directly in the join conditions, the query might leverage indexed columns (assuming indexes on `o_orderdate` and `l_shipdate`) more effectively, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages of the query.

This approach assumes that the database can more efficiently handle joins when fewer rows are involved, and that filtering as early as possible in the join conditions can lead to performance improvements. The effectiveness of these optimizations can vary based on the database schema, the presence of indexes, and the specific database system's query optimizer.
