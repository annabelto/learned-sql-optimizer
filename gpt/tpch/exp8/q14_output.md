To further optimize the query for better performance, we need to consider additional aspects such as indexing, more efficient use of conditions, and possibly reevaluating the join conditions. However, since the focus here is on rewriting the query using the provided rules, I'll ensure the application of these rules is optimal and check for any possible improvements in the way the query is structured.

### Re-evaluating the Optimized Query:
The previous optimization focused on restructuring the query using explicit JOIN syntax and moving conditions appropriately. Given the performance results, it's possible that the explicit JOIN syntax might not be the most efficient for this particular query setup or the database's current indexing and configuration.

### Further Optimization:
1. **Ensure optimal use of indexes**: If `l_partkey` in `lineitem` and `p_partkey` in `part` are indexed, the join should be efficient. However, ensuring that the query planner can effectively use these indexes is crucial.
2. **Filter pushdown**: Pushing the date filters on `lineitem` before the join might help reduce the size of the join, depending on the database's query planner's effectiveness.

Let's rewrite the query considering these points:

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 100.00 * SUM(CASE WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) ELSE 0 END) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS promo_revenue 
FROM lineitem
JOIN part ON lineitem.l_partkey = part.p_partkey
WHERE lineitem.l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-10-01' 
AND lineitem.l_shipdate < DATE '1995-10-01' + INTERVAL '1' month
LIMIT ALL;
```

This query is essentially the same as previously optimized but re-emphasized to ensure clarity on the join and filter conditions. If this still does not perform better, I would recommend looking into the following:
- **Indexing**: Ensure both `l_partkey` and `p_partkey` are indexed.
- **Statistics**: Update statistics on the tables to ensure the query planner has the latest information.
- **Explain Plan**: Review the explain plan for both the original and optimized queries to identify where the differences lie, particularly in how the joins and filters are being executed.

If performance issues persist, further investigation into the database's physical design and configuration would be necessary, which might involve considerations outside the scope of simple query rewriting.
