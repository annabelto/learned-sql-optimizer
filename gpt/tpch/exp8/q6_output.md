Given that the performance of the optimized query matches the original query, it appears that the original query is already well-optimized for the given conditions and database schema. However, to ensure we are providing the best possible version, let's ensure that the query is as clean and efficient as possible without unnecessary modifications.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1 year'
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.02 AND 0.04
  AND l_quantity < 25;
```

**Changes Made:**
- I have reverted to using a simple and direct `BETWEEN` clause for `l_discount` with explicit values (0.02 and 0.04) which are the results of the arithmetic operations originally provided. This ensures clarity and might help in some database systems where constant folding (simplifying constant expressions at compile time) is not optimally performed.
- Removed `LIMIT ALL` as it is redundant and does not affect the result.

**Rationale:**
- Using explicit constants in the `BETWEEN` clause can sometimes help the query optimizer by reducing the complexity of the expression it needs to evaluate.
- Ensuring that the date range and numeric filters are straightforward to potentially leverage index scans more effectively.

**Additional Notes:**
- If this query still performs identically to the original, it suggests that the database's query optimizer is already handling the original query efficiently. Further improvements would likely require changes at the database configuration level, such as tuning parameters or updating statistics.
- It's also recommended to ensure that the table `lineitem` has appropriate indexes on `l_shipdate`, `l_discount`, and `l_quantity`. If these indexes are missing, adding them could improve the query performance significantly.
- Regularly updating the database statistics can help maintain the performance of the query as data grows or changes over time.
