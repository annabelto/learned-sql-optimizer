Given the consistent performance results and the challenges in surpassing the original query's execution time, it appears that the original query might already be optimized effectively for the given database schema and data distribution. However, I will attempt one more optimization strategy focusing on minimizing the computational overhead and ensuring the most efficient use of indexes and join operations.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
-- Optimize by focusing on efficient execution of joins and minimizing overhead in subquery computation
SELECT ps_partkey, SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS total_value
FROM partsupp
JOIN supplier ON partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey
JOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey
WHERE nation.n_name = 'FRANCE'
GROUP BY ps_partkey
HAVING SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (
    SELECT SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000
    FROM partsupp
    INNER JOIN supplier ON partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey
    INNER JOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey
    WHERE nation.n_name = 'FRANCE'
)
ORDER BY total_value DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Key Changes and Rationale:
1. **Efficient Join Operations**: The query continues to use explicit JOIN syntax, which is crucial for clarity and potentially allows PostgreSQL to optimize join operations more effectively. The joins are structured to ensure that the filtering condition on `nation.n_name = 'FRANCE'` is applied as early as possible in the execution plan to reduce the size of the dataset being processed in subsequent steps.

2. **Subquery Optimization**: The subquery used in the `HAVING` clause is structured similarly to ensure that it uses the same efficient path of execution. This helps in maintaining consistency in how the data is accessed and processed in both the main query and the subquery.

3. **Index Utilization**: It is critical to ensure that there are efficient indexes on the columns used in joins (`ps_suppkey`, `s_suppkey`, `s_nationkey`, `n_nationkey`) and on the filtering column (`n_name`). Proper indexing is essential for improving join performance and speeding up the filtering process.

4. **Analyze and Vacuum**: Running `ANALYZE` and `VACUUM` on the involved tables (`partsupp`, `supplier`, `nation`) can help PostgreSQL optimize query plans based on the most current data distribution statistics.

5. **Execution Plan Review**: Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to inspect the execution plan is recommended. This tool can provide insights into how the query is being executed and whether there are any unexpected scans or joins that could be optimized further.

This approach aims to refine the query by ensuring that all elements are as streamlined as possible while maintaining the necessary logical structure for accurate results. The focus is on ensuring that the database's physical design, such as indexes, is optimally utilized to enhance performance. If this version of the query still does not improve performance, it might be beneficial to review the physical server resources or consider if the original query is already near optimal given the current database configuration and data characteristics.
