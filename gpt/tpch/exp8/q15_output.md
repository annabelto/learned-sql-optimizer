To optimize the given query, we will apply the following rules:

1. Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.
2. Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.
3. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.
4. Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.
5. Use explicit join conditions.
6. Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.

### Optimized Query

```sql
-- Create a view to calculate total revenue per supplier
CREATE VIEW revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) AS 
SELECT l_suppkey, SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1996-07-01' AND l_shipdate < DATE '1996-07-01' + INTERVAL '3' MONTH
GROUP BY l_suppkey;

-- Select supplier details with the maximum total revenue
SELECT s.s_suppkey, s.s_name, s.s_address, s.s_phone, r.total_revenue
FROM supplier s
JOIN revenue0 r ON s.s_suppkey = r.supplier_no
WHERE r.total_revenue = (
    SELECT MAX(total_revenue) FROM revenue0
)
ORDER BY s.s_suppkey
LIMIT ALL;

-- Drop the view
DROP VIEW revenue0;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Rule 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** The original query used a comma-separated list of tables (`supplier, revenue0`) in the `FROM` clause and linked them using the `WHERE` clause. This was replaced with an explicit `JOIN` syntax (`supplier s JOIN revenue0 r ON s.s_suppkey = r.supplier_no`), which clearly specifies the relationship between the tables.
- **Rule 6:** The condition linking `s_suppkey` and `supplier_no` was moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the `JOIN`, making the join conditions explicit and localized to the join operation itself. This can help improve readability and potentially allow the database engine to optimize the join operation more effectively.

These changes make the query more readable and maintainable, and they adhere to modern SQL practices by using explicit joins.
