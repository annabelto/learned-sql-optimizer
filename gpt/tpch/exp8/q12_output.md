### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT l_shipmode, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' OR o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_line_count, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' AND o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS low_line_count 
FROM orders 
JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
WHERE l_shipmode IN ('RAIL', 'TRUCK') 
  AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate 
  AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate 
  AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
  AND l_receiptdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' year 
GROUP BY l_shipmode 
ORDER BY l_shipmode;
```

This query maintains the explicit JOIN syntax and ensures that all conditions are placed in the WHERE clause to potentially leverage indexes more effectively. The removal of `LIMIT ALL` (which is redundant as it does not limit the number of rows) might slightly reduce parsing overhead.
