To optimize the given TPC-H query, we will apply the provided data-independent rewrite rules. The original query already uses explicit join syntax and has conditions appropriately placed in the ON clause of the JOIN. However, we can still review and ensure that the query is structured as clearly and efficiently as possible.

### Original Query:
```sql
select c_count, count(*) as custdist
from (
    select c_custkey, count(o_orderkey)
    from customer
    left outer join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
    group by c_custkey
) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by c_count
order by custdist desc, c_count desc
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applied Rules:
1. **Use explicit join syntax instead of comma-separated tables in the FROM clause.**  
   The query already uses explicit join syntax (`left outer join`), so no changes are needed here.

2. **Replace implicit joins with explicit joins.**  
   The query does not contain any implicit joins; it explicitly uses `left outer join`.

3. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for linking tables.**  
   The linking condition `c_custkey = o_custkey` is already in the ON clause of the JOIN, which is correct.

4. **Use JOIN instead of WHERE for combining tables.**  
   The combining condition `o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'` is also in the ON clause, which is appropriate for a LEFT JOIN to ensure that the filter is applied before the grouping.

5. **Use explicit join conditions.**  
   The join conditions are explicitly stated in the ON clause.

6. **Move conditions from WHERE clause to ON clause in JOINs.**  
   All relevant conditions are already in the ON clause.

### Conclusion:
The query is already optimized according to the provided rules. It uses explicit join syntax, places conditions in the ON clause correctly, and avoids implicit joins. Therefore, no further modifications are necessary.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
select c_count, count(*) as custdist
from (
    select c_custkey, count(o_orderkey)
    from customer
    left outer join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
    group by c_custkey
) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by c_count
order by custdist desc, c_count desc
LIMIT ALL;
```

This query is already well-structured for performance in a PostgreSQL environment, assuming appropriate indexes and database tuning are in place.
