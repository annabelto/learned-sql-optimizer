To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that aim to simplify the query, reduce the number of rows processed, and improve the join conditions. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving predicates into subqueries to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution plan. We can push the condition `n_name = 'FRANCE'` into the subquery to reduce the number of rows joined with the `supplier` table.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a subquery or a join does not affect the final result, it can be eliminated. However, in this query, all joins seem necessary for the final result.

3. **Subquery Flattening**: Convert subqueries into joins where possible to allow the optimizer more flexibility in reordering operations. The subquery filtering `partsupp` can be rewritten as a join.

4. **Use of EXISTS instead of IN**: When checking for existence, `EXISTS` can be more efficient than `IN` because it stops processing as soon as it finds the first match.

5. **Column Pruning**: Remove unnecessary columns from the SELECT clause of subqueries if they are not used outside the subquery.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT s_name, s_address 
FROM supplier
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
WHERE n_name = 'FRANCE'
AND s_suppkey IN (
    SELECT ps_suppkey 
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN (
        SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, l_suppkey AS agg_suppkey, 0.5 * SUM(l_quantity) AS agg_quantity
        FROM lineitem
        WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' year
        GROUP BY l_partkey, l_suppkey
    ) AS agg_lineitem ON agg_partkey = ps_partkey AND agg_suppkey = ps_suppkey
    WHERE EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM part
        WHERE p_partkey = ps_partkey AND p_name LIKE 'linen%'
    )
    AND ps_availqty > agg_quantity
)
ORDER BY s_name
LIMIT ALL;
```

**Explanation of Changes**:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The condition `n_name = 'FRANCE'` is moved up to the main query to reduce the number of rows joined.
- **Subquery Flattening**: The subquery for `partsupp` is rewritten as a join.
- **Use of EXISTS**: Changed the `IN` clause to an `EXISTS` clause for checking parts that start with 'linen'.
- **Column Pruning**: Ensured that only necessary columns are selected in subqueries.

These changes should help in optimizing the execution of the query by reducing the amount of data processed and allowing the database more flexibility in executing joins and filters.
