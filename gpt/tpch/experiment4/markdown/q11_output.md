To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without changing the semantics of the query. Here are the steps and rules I will use:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (filters) closer to the data source. It reduces the number of rows early in the execution plan, which decreases the amount of data processed in later stages.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by calculating common expressions once and reusing the result. In this query, the subquery in the `HAVING` clause is executed for each group, but it can be computed once and reused.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, and if the filtering can be achieved by other means (e.g., using exists), consider eliminating the join.

4. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This improves readability and potentially allows the optimizer to better understand the join conditions and optimize accordingly.

### Optimized Query

```sql
WITH france_parts AS (
    SELECT ps_partkey, ps_suppkey, ps_supplycost, ps_availqty
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN supplier ON ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
    JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    WHERE n_name = 'FRANCE'
),
total_value AS (
    SELECT sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000 AS threshold
    FROM france_parts
)
SELECT ps_partkey, sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS value
FROM france_parts
GROUP BY ps_partkey
HAVING sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (SELECT threshold FROM total_value)
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied by moving the filter `n_name = 'FRANCE'` directly into the subquery `france_parts`, which reduces the dataset early.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: The subquery calculating the threshold value is moved into a CTE (`total_value`), which is computed once and used in the `HAVING` clause, avoiding repeated computation.

3. **Join Elimination**: Not directly applied here as all joins contribute to the result. However, restructuring into CTEs clarifies which parts of the data are necessary for the final output.

4. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit joins in the FROM clause to explicit JOINs, which are clearer and can help the optimizer.

These changes should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and avoiding redundant calculations.
