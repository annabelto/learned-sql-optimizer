To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the amount of data processed by filtering out rows early in the execution plan.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by calculating common expressions once and reusing the result.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a subquery or a join does not contribute to the final result, it can be eliminated.

### Analysis of the Query:

The original query filters customers based on their phone country code and account balance, and checks if they have no corresponding orders. It computes the average account balance for customers with a positive balance from specific countries and uses this average to further filter the main query.

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We push the condition on `c_phone` and `c_acctbal` directly into the subquery where the average account balance is calculated. This reduces the number of rows processed in the subquery.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: The list of country codes and the condition on `c_acctbal` are repeated. We can compute these once and reuse them.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
WITH filtered_customers AS (
    SELECT 
        c_custkey, 
        c_acctbal, 
        substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) as cntrycode
    FROM 
        customer
    WHERE 
        substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) IN ('16', '28', '14', '34', '21', '20', '29')
),
avg_acctbal AS (
    SELECT 
        avg(c_acctbal) as avg_balance
    FROM 
        filtered_customers
    WHERE 
        c_acctbal > 0.00
),
cust_without_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        cntrycode, 
        c_acctbal
    FROM 
        filtered_customers
    WHERE 
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM orders
            WHERE o_custkey = filtered_customers.c_custkey
        )
        AND c_acctbal > (SELECT avg_balance FROM avg_acctbal)
)
SELECT 
    cntrycode, 
    count(*) as numcust, 
    sum(c_acctbal) as totacctbal
FROM 
    cust_without_orders
GROUP BY 
    cntrycode
ORDER BY 
    cntrycode
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:

- **WITH Clauses**: These are used to define common sub-expressions (`filtered_customers`, `avg_acctbal`, `cust_without_orders`). This makes the query more readable and avoids recalculating the same expressions.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `c_phone` and `c_acctbal` are pushed down to the earliest possible point in the query to reduce the amount of data processed.
- **Join Elimination**: The original query did not explicitly use joins that could be eliminated, but restructuring the query using WITH clauses helps in logically separating the operations, which can be beneficial for the query planner.

This rewritten query should perform better due to reduced data scanning and reusing computed results, making it more efficient in terms of execution time and resource usage.
