To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the underlying data. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving predicates (conditions) as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the number of rows processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Use of Explicit Joins**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it makes the join conditions clearer and more manageable for the query optimizer.

3. **Elimination of Redundant Expressions**: Simplifying or removing unnecessary expressions or conditions that do not affect the result.

4. **Column Pruning**: Select only the columns that are necessary for the final output or are used in the JOIN, WHERE, or HAVING clauses.

Here's how these rules are applied to the given query:

### Original Query:
```sql
select l_shipmode,
       sum(case when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' then 1 else 0 end) as high_line_count,
       sum(case when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' then 1 else 0 end) as low_line_count
from orders, lineitem
where o_orderkey = l_orderkey
      and l_shipmode in ('RAIL', 'TRUCK')
      and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
      and l_shipdate < l_commitdate
      and l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01'
      and l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by l_shipmode
order by l_shipmode
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules:

1. **Use of Explicit Joins**:
   Convert the implicit join to an explicit INNER JOIN for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   Move conditions related to `lineitem` directly into the ON clause of the JOIN, which can help in executing these conditions earlier in the query process.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT l_shipmode,
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' OR o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_line_count,
       SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' AND o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS low_line_count
FROM orders
JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
              AND l_shipmode IN ('RAIL', 'TRUCK')
              AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
              AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate
              AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
              AND l_receiptdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' year
GROUP BY l_shipmode
ORDER BY l_shipmode
LIMIT ALL;
```

In this optimized query:
- The explicit JOIN syntax clarifies the relationship between `orders` and `lineitem`.
- Conditions specific to `lineitem` are moved to the JOIN clause, allowing the database engine to reduce the dataset earlier in the query execution.
- The query remains functionally equivalent to the original but is structured for potentially better performance.
