To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, reduce the amount of data processed, and improve execution efficiency without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates closer to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed in the early stages of the query, which can significantly decrease the overall workload.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result set (i.e., it does not filter or add columns to the output), it can be eliminated. However, in this query, all joins are necessary as they contribute to the final result.

3. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax improves readability and often allows the database engine to optimize the query plan more effectively.

4. **Removing Redundant GROUP BY Expressions**: If the grouping is already unique by a subset of the GROUP BY clause or if it matches the primary key, some elements of the GROUP BY might be redundant.

5. **Limit Clause Optimization**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant because it does not limit the result set. Removing it simplifies the query.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    c.c_name, 
    c.c_custkey, 
    o.o_orderkey, 
    o.o_orderdate, 
    o.o_totalprice, 
    SUM(l.l_quantity)
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
JOIN 
    lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
WHERE 
    o.o_orderkey IN (
        SELECT 
            l2.l_orderkey 
        FROM 
            lineitem l2 
        GROUP BY 
            l2.l_orderkey 
        HAVING 
            SUM(l2.l_quantity) > 313
    )
GROUP BY 
    c.c_name, 
    c.c_custkey, 
    o.o_orderkey, 
    o.o_orderdate, 
    o.o_totalprice
ORDER BY 
    o.o_totalprice DESC, 
    o.o_orderdate;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied by ensuring conditions are checked as early as possible, especially within the subquery.
- **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Changed the implicit joins to explicit JOINs for clarity and potential optimization benefits.
- **Removing Redundant GROUP BY Expressions**: Kept as is because each column in the GROUP BY clause contributes to defining the granularity of the aggregation.
- **Limit Clause Optimization**: Removed `LIMIT ALL` as it is redundant.

This rewritten query should perform better due to clearer join conditions and reduced data processing from the early application of filters.
