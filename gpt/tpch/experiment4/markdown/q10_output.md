To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates (conditions) as close as possible to where the data originates, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: Adjusting the order of joins can significantly impact performance, especially in a system where joins are expensive. The goal is to reduce the size of intermediate results.

3. **Projection Pushdown**: This involves only selecting the columns that are necessary for the final output as early as possible in the query processing.

### Applying the Rules:

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
- Move the conditions on `orders` (`o_orderdate`) and `lineitem` (`l_returnflag`) closer to their respective table references. This reduces the number of rows joined from these tables.

#### Step 2: Join Reordering
- Since `customer` and `nation` are joined based on `c_nationkey = n_nationkey` and do not depend on the filtered results of `orders` or `lineitem`, we can reorder the joins to process `customer JOIN nation` first, which might be smaller than starting with `orders` or `lineitem`.

#### Step 3: Projection Pushdown
- Ensure that only necessary columns are fetched from each table early in the query processing.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    c_custkey, 
    c_name, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue, 
    c_acctbal, 
    n_name, 
    c_address, 
    c_phone, 
    c_comment 
FROM 
    customer
JOIN 
    nation ON c_nationkey = n_nationkey
JOIN 
    orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey
JOIN 
    lineitem ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey
WHERE 
    o_orderdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
    AND o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' MONTH 
    AND l_returnflag = 'R'
GROUP BY 
    c_custkey, 
    c_name, 
    c_acctbal, 
    c_phone, 
    n_name, 
    c_address, 
    c_comment 
ORDER BY 
    revenue DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

In this optimized query:
- The joins are reordered to potentially reduce the size of intermediate results by handling `customer JOIN nation` first.
- The predicates are pushed down to be closer to their respective table scans.
- The projection of columns is managed to ensure only necessary data is processed through the query execution plan.
