To optimize the given PostgreSQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result set. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows early in the execution plan, which can decrease the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages.

2. **Use of EXISTS instead of NOT IN**: Changing `NOT IN` to `NOT EXISTS` can be beneficial because `NOT EXISTS` stops processing as soon as it finds the first match, which can be more efficient than `NOT IN`, which requires all rows to be processed to ensure that a value does not exist.

3. **Elimination of Redundant Conditions**: Simplify or remove any conditions that are unnecessarily complex or redundant.

4. **Selection of Efficient Data Types and Functions**: Ensure that the data types and functions used are optimal for performance.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT p_brand, p_type, p_size, COUNT(DISTINCT ps_suppkey) AS supplier_cnt
FROM partsupp
JOIN part ON p_partkey = ps_partkey
WHERE p_brand <> 'Brand#24'
  AND p_type NOT LIKE 'STANDARD BURNISHED%'
  AND p_size IN (44, 6, 46, 36, 42, 17, 26, 18)
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM supplier
    WHERE s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
      AND s_comment LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
  )
GROUP BY p_brand, p_type, p_size
ORDER BY supplier_cnt DESC, p_brand, p_type, p_size
LIMIT ALL;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied by ensuring that all relevant filters (`p_brand`, `p_type`, `p_size`, and the subquery condition) are placed directly in the `WHERE` clause.
- **Use of EXISTS instead of NOT IN**: Changed the subquery to use `NOT EXISTS` for potentially better performance.
- **Elimination of Redundant Conditions**: No redundant conditions were identified in the original query, so none were removed.
- **Selection of Efficient Data Types and Functions**: The query already uses efficient conditions and data types based on the given schema and requirements.

This rewritten query should perform better due to the more efficient handling of subqueries and the early reduction of data size through predicate pushdown.
