To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the query's performance without altering the result. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates as close as possible to the data source. This reduces the number of rows processed in the later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: Adjusting the order of joins can significantly impact performance, especially if it allows us to reduce the size of intermediate results early in the query execution.

3. **Elimination of Subqueries**: If possible, replacing subqueries with joins or applying other transformations to simplify the query.

4. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: This can make the query easier to read and optimize by the query planner.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: We push conditions related to `orders` and `lineitem` down to the respective FROM clauses where possible.
   
2. **Join Reordering**: We start with `nation` since it's filtered by a constant (`n_name = 'KENYA'`), which likely reduces the result set size early.

3. **Elimination of Subqueries**: The subqueries in EXISTS and NOT EXISTS are crucial for the logic and cannot be directly transformed into JOINs without changing the semantics. However, ensuring they are correlated subqueries (which they are) is essential for performance.

4. **Use of Explicit JOIN Syntax**: Rewriting the query using explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.

### Optimized Query:

```sql
SELECT s_name, COUNT(*) AS numwait
FROM nation
JOIN supplier ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
JOIN lineitem l1 ON s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey
JOIN orders ON o_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
WHERE n_name = 'KENYA'
  AND o_orderstatus = 'F'
  AND l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM lineitem l2
    WHERE l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
      AND l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
  )
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM lineitem l3
    WHERE l3.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
      AND l3.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
      AND l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate
  )
GROUP BY s_name
ORDER BY numwait DESC, s_name
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions like `o_orderstatus = 'F'` and `l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate` are pushed down.
- **Join Reordering**: Starting with `nation` filtered by `n_name = 'KENYA'` reduces the dataset size early.
- **Explicit JOIN Syntax**: The query now uses explicit JOINs, which are generally better optimized by PostgreSQL.

This rewritten query should perform better due to reduced intermediate dataset sizes and clearer structure for the query planner to optimize.
