To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. The rules include predicate pushdown, join reordering, and using explicit joins instead of implicit joins. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter conditions closer to the data source. In this case, the condition `p_name like '%white%'` can be pushed down to reduce the size of the join.

2. **Explicit Joins**: Replace implicit joins (using WHERE clauses) with explicit JOIN syntax. This makes the query easier to read and often allows the database more flexibility in execution planning.

3. **Join Reordering**: Although the optimal order of joins typically depends on the specific database statistics and the query planner, logically restructuring joins can sometimes help. In this case, we start with smaller tables or those reduced by filters.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    n.n_name AS nation, 
    EXTRACT(year FROM o.o_orderdate) AS o_year, 
    SUM(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount) - ps.ps_supplycost * l.l_quantity) AS sum_profit
FROM 
    nation n
JOIN 
    supplier s ON s.s_nationkey = n.n_nationkey
JOIN 
    partsupp ps ON s.s_suppkey = ps.ps_suppkey
JOIN 
    lineitem l ON l.l_suppkey = ps.ps_suppkey AND l.l_partkey = ps.ps_partkey
JOIN 
    orders o ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
JOIN 
    part p ON p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE 
    p.p_name LIKE '%white%'
GROUP BY 
    n.n_name, EXTRACT(year FROM o.o_orderdate)
ORDER BY 
    n.n_name, EXTRACT(year FROM o.o_orderdate) DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Explicit Joins**: Changed all joins to use the explicit `JOIN` syntax with `ON` clauses for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The condition on `p.p_name` is applied directly in the `WHERE` clause immediately after the join with the `part` table, which should help in reducing the number of rows early in the query processing.
- **Join Reordering**: The query starts with the `nation` and `supplier` tables, which are directly related through `s_nationkey`, and then proceeds to other tables. This order might be more efficient depending on the distribution and size of the tables, although the actual best order should be determined based on specific database statistics.

These changes aim to make the query more efficient by reducing the number of rows processed in the joins and making the execution plan clearer to the query optimizer.
