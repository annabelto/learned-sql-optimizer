To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance of the query execution. The rules I will apply include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the filter (predicate) closer to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed in the subsequent stages of the query, which can significantly improve performance.

2. **Use of Indexes**: If there are indexes on the columns used in the `WHERE` clause or the `GROUP BY` clause, the database can retrieve and sort data more efficiently.

3. **Elimination of Redundant Operations**: In this case, the `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it will clean up the query without affecting its functionality.

4. **Column Pruning**: Ensure that only the columns needed for the final output are fetched in the query. However, in this query, all selected columns are used in calculations or the final output, so no columns can be pruned.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus, 
    SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
    AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
    AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
    AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
    COUNT(*) AS count_order 
FROM 
    lineitem 
WHERE 
    l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '70 day' 
GROUP BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
ORDER BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The `WHERE` clause is already optimally placed to filter rows before grouping and aggregation.
- **Use of Indexes**: Assuming there is an index on `l_shipdate`, `l_returnflag`, and `l_linestatus`, the query will benefit from faster filtering and grouping. This isn't explicitly shown in the query but is an important consideration for physical database tuning.
- **Elimination of Redundant Operations**: Removed `LIMIT ALL` as it is redundant.
- **Column Pruning**: No changes were made here as all selected columns are necessary for the output.

This rewritten query should perform better than the original, assuming appropriate indexes are in place. The actual performance gain can be verified by running the query on the database and examining the execution plan.
