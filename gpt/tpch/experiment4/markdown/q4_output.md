To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules. These rules aim to simplify the query, reduce the amount of data processed, and potentially improve the execution plan chosen by the PostgreSQL query planner. Here are the steps and rules I will apply:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving the predicates (filters) as close as possible to where the data originates. This can reduce the number of rows processed early in the query execution.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: Simplify or eliminate expressions that are redundant or that compute the same value multiple times.

3. **Use Explicit JOINs Instead of Subqueries**: Convert the EXISTS subquery to an explicit JOIN, which can be more efficient in some cases because it allows the optimizer more flexibility in reordering operations.

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT o_orderpriority, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
WHERE o_orderdate >= DATE '1996-01-01'
  AND o_orderdate < DATE '1996-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' month
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE l_orderkey = o_orderkey
      AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
  )
GROUP BY o_orderpriority
ORDER BY o_orderpriority
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applying Optimization Rules

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: The filter conditions on `o_orderdate` are already at the top level where they should be. The subquery filter `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate` can be considered already pushed down.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Expressions**: The expression `DATE '1996-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' month` can be precomputed if it is invariant, but this is typically handled by the query planner itself.

3. **Use Explicit JOINs Instead of Subqueries**: Convert the EXISTS subquery to a JOIN. This will involve joining the `orders` table with the `lineitem` table on `l_orderkey = o_orderkey` and moving the condition `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate` to the JOIN condition.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT o_orderpriority, COUNT(DISTINCT orders.o_orderkey) AS order_count
FROM orders
JOIN lineitem ON orders.o_orderkey = lineitem.l_orderkey AND lineitem.l_commitdate < lineitem.l_receiptdate
WHERE orders.o_orderdate >= DATE '1996-01-01'
  AND orders.o_orderdate < DATE '1996-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' month
GROUP BY o_orderpriority
ORDER BY o_orderpriority
LIMIT ALL;
```

In this optimized query:
- The EXISTS subquery is replaced by a JOIN, which might allow the database to optimize the join order and method.
- The COUNT function now explicitly counts distinct `o_orderkey` to ensure that the semantics of the EXISTS (which implies distinctness) are preserved.
- All other aspects of the query remain unchanged, preserving the original intent and ensuring the output remains consistent.
