I apologize for the repeated errors in my previous responses. Let's ensure the optimized query strictly adheres to the logic of the original query while maintaining the same output.

### Optimized Query

```sql
-- Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) for the revenue calculation
WITH revenue0 AS (
    SELECT 
        l_suppkey AS supplier_no, 
        SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS total_revenue
    FROM 
        lineitem
    WHERE 
        l_shipdate >= DATE '1996-07-01' AND 
        l_shipdate < DATE '1996-07-01' + INTERVAL '3' month
    GROUP BY 
        l_suppkey
)

-- Selecting suppliers with the maximum total revenue
SELECT 
    s.s_suppkey, 
    s.s_name, 
    s.s_address, 
    s.s_phone, 
    r.total_revenue
FROM 
    supplier s
JOIN 
    revenue0 r ON s.s_suppkey = r.supplier_no
WHERE 
    r.total_revenue = (SELECT MAX(total_revenue) FROM revenue0)
ORDER BY 
    s.s_suppkey;
```

In this corrected version:
- I have used a CTE (`revenue0`) to replace the view creation. This simplifies the query by avoiding the need to create and drop a view, which can be beneficial in terms of performance and cleanliness of the code.
- The subquery for calculating the maximum total revenue is retained in the `WHERE` clause to ensure that the output matches exactly with the original query. This subquery ensures that only suppliers with the maximum total revenue are selected.
- The `ORDER BY` clause is maintained to ensure the results are ordered by `s_suppkey`.

This version should now produce the exact same results as the original query while incorporating some optimizations for better performance and readability.
