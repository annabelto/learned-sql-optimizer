To achieve a better optimization, we need to reconsider the approach, especially focusing on the execution plan that PostgreSQL uses. Given the slight performance degradation in previous attempts, it's crucial to simplify the query and ensure that it leverages indexes effectively without introducing unnecessary complexity.

### Original Query:
```sql
SELECT l_orderkey, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue, 
       o_orderdate, 
       o_shippriority 
FROM customer, orders, lineitem 
WHERE c_mktsegment = 'AUTOMOBILE' 
  AND c_custkey = o_custkey 
  AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
  AND o_orderdate < DATE '1995-03-20' 
  AND l_shipdate > DATE '1995-03-20' 
GROUP BY l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority 
ORDER BY revenue DESC, o_orderdate 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Refined Optimization Strategy:

#### 1. **Simplify Join Conditions**: Instead of using subqueries or changing the join structure significantly, maintain the original join structure but ensure it's using the most efficient path.

#### 2. **Leverage Indexes**: Confirm that indexes on `c_custkey`, `o_custkey`, `l_orderkey`, `o_orderkey`, `o_orderdate`, and `l_shipdate` are being used. If not, the database might be performing full table scans which are inefficient.

#### 3. **Columnar Selection**: Only select columns that are necessary before the join operation to reduce the amount of data being processed.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT l_orderkey, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue, 
       o_orderdate, 
       o_shippriority 
FROM (
    SELECT c_custkey
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_mktsegment = 'AUTOMOBILE'
) c
JOIN (
    SELECT o_custkey, o_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority
    FROM orders
    WHERE o_orderdate < DATE '1995-03-20'
) o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
JOIN (
    SELECT l_orderkey, l_extendedprice, l_discount
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE l_shipdate > DATE '1995-03-20'
) l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
GROUP BY l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority 
ORDER BY revenue DESC, o_orderdate 
LIMIT ALL;
```

In this version:
- Each table involved in the join is pre-filtered using a subquery, but only necessary columns are selected to reduce the data footprint.
- The join conditions remain straightforward, and the query structure is simplified to ensure clarity and potentially better use of indexes.

This approach should help in reducing the amount of data processed during the join operations and make better use of indexes. If performance does not improve, further investigation into the execution plan and physical database design (like indexing strategy) would be necessary.
