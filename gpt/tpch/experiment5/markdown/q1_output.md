To further optimize the query and attempt to improve its performance beyond the original execution time, we need to explore additional strategies that might not have been fully utilized in previous attempts. Here, we will focus on fine-tuning the query and ensuring optimal use of PostgreSQL's capabilities.

### Optimized Query
```sql
-- Utilizing more efficient date operations and ensuring optimal use of indexes
SELECT l_returnflag, 
       l_linestatus, 
       SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
       AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
       AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
       AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
       COUNT(*) AS count_order 
FROM lineitem 
WHERE l_shipdate <= '1998-09-22' -- Pre-calculated date to avoid repeated date computations
GROUP BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus 
ORDER BY l_returnflag, l_linestatus;
```

**Optimization Details:**
1. **Pre-calculated Date**: Instead of calculating the date on the fly using `DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '70 days'`, the date is pre-calculated and hardcoded as '1998-09-22'. This avoids the overhead of date computation for each execution of the query.

2. **Index Utilization**: This query assumes that there are effective indexes on `l_shipdate`, `l_returnflag`, and `l_linestatus`. If not already present, consider creating a combined index that includes these fields, particularly focusing on `l_shipdate` for the `WHERE` clause and `l_returnflag`, `l_linestatus` for the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses. This can be particularly effective if the `l_shipdate` is a leading column in the index.

3. **Execution Plan Review**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to review the execution plan of this query to ensure that the indexes are being used effectively and that there are no unexpected sequential scans or other inefficient operations.

4. **System Configuration**: Ensure that PostgreSQL configuration parameters such as `work_mem`, `shared_buffers`, and `effective_cache_size` are tuned according to the system's hardware specifications to optimize performance.

5. **Parallel Query Processing**: Make sure that PostgreSQL is configured to effectively use parallel processing for this query if supported by the system. Settings like `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` can be adjusted to increase parallelism for aggregation and sorting operations.

By implementing these optimizations, the query is streamlined to reduce computational overhead and improve index utilization, which should help in achieving better performance compared to the original execution time.
