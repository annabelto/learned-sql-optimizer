To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance by reducing the amount of data processed and the complexity of the operations. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving predicates (filters) closer to the data source. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the size of intermediate results, which can decrease the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages of the query.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to minimize the size of intermediate results. Smaller intermediate results can lead to faster query execution times.

3. **Column Pruning**: This involves removing unnecessary columns from the SELECT and JOIN clauses that are not needed for the final output. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT o_year, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN nation = 'MOZAMBIQUE' THEN volume ELSE 0 END) / SUM(volume) AS mkt_share 
FROM (
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) AS o_year, 
           l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) AS volume, 
           n2.n_name AS nation 
    FROM lineitem 
    JOIN orders ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
    JOIN customer ON o_custkey = c_custkey 
    JOIN nation n1 ON c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey 
    JOIN region ON n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey 
    JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = l_suppkey 
    JOIN nation n2 ON s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey 
    JOIN part ON p_partkey = l_partkey 
    WHERE r_name = 'AFRICA' 
      AND o_orderdate BETWEEN DATE '1995-01-01' AND DATE '1996-12-31' 
      AND p_type = 'PROMO BRUSHED BRASS'
) AS all_nations 
GROUP BY o_year 
ORDER BY o_year 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Filters such as `r_name = 'AFRICA'`, `o_orderdate BETWEEN DATE '1995-01-01' AND DATE '1996-12-31'`, and `p_type = 'PROMO BRUSHED BRASS'` are pushed down to reduce the amount of data processed in the subquery.
- **Join Reordering**: The `JOIN` operations are reordered to start with `lineitem`, `orders`, and `customer`, which are likely to be the largest tables and have the most selective filters (`o_orderdate` and `c_custkey`). This helps in reducing the size of the dataset early in the processing.
- **Column Pruning**: Only the necessary columns for the final output are included in the SELECT statements of the subquery.

These optimizations should help in reducing the execution time of the query by minimizing the amount of data processed and the complexity of the operations involved.
