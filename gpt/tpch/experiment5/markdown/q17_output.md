To optimize the given query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that can potentially improve the performance by reducing the amount of data processed and the complexity of the operations. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (filters) as close as possible to the data source. By applying filters early, we reduce the size of intermediate results and thus speed up the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute additional columns or rows to the result, it can be eliminated. However, in this query, all joins seem necessary to achieve the desired result.

3. **Use of Explicit JOINs**: Changing implicit joins (comma-separated in the FROM clause) to explicit JOIN syntax can improve readability and sometimes performance, as it makes the join conditions clearer and allows the optimizer to better understand the query structure.

4. **Column Pruning**: Only select columns that are necessary for the final output or conditions, reducing the amount of data processed.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly
FROM part
JOIN lineitem ON p_partkey = l_partkey
JOIN (
    SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 
           0.2 * avg(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_partkey
) AS part_agg ON part_agg.agg_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey
WHERE p_brand = 'Brand#41'
  AND p_container = 'WRAP BAG'
  AND l_quantity < part_agg.avg_quantity
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown**: The conditions on `p_brand` and `p_container` are applied directly in the WHERE clause, which is already optimal in terms of predicate placement.
- **Use of Explicit JOINs**: The query now uses explicit JOIN syntax (`JOIN ... ON ...`) instead of commas in the FROM clause. This makes the join conditions explicit and can help the database optimizer.
- **Column Pruning**: The query only selects the columns necessary for computing the final result. Additional columns from the `part` and `lineitem` tables are not fetched unless needed for join conditions or filters.

These changes aim to make the query more efficient by clarifying join conditions and ensuring that filters are applied as early as possible. The use of explicit JOINs also helps in understanding the query better, which can aid in further optimizations if needed.
