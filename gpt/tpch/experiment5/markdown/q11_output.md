To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without changing the semantics of the query. Here are the steps and rules used:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (filters) closer to the data source. By applying filters as early as possible, we reduce the number of rows and hence the amount of data that needs to be processed in subsequent steps.

2. **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: This rule identifies and eliminates redundancy by calculating common expressions once and reusing the result. In the given query, the subquery calculates a value that is used in the `HAVING` clause. We can compute this value once and reuse it.

3. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, and if the filtering can be achieved by other means (e.g., using exists), the join can be eliminated. However, in this query, all joins contribute to the result set directly or indirectly, so this rule does not apply here.

4. **Use of Temporary Tables**: For complex queries, especially those involving subqueries that are executed multiple times, using a temporary table to store intermediate results can be beneficial.

### Optimized Query

```sql
-- Calculate the threshold value once and use it in the main query
WITH france_parts AS (
    SELECT ps_partkey, ps_suppkey, ps_supplycost, ps_availqty
    FROM partsupp, supplier, nation
    WHERE ps_suppkey = s_suppkey AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey AND n_name = 'FRANCE'
),
threshold AS (
    SELECT SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000 AS threshold_value
    FROM france_parts
)
SELECT ps_partkey, SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS value
FROM france_parts
GROUP BY ps_partkey
HAVING SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (SELECT threshold_value FROM threshold)
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied by filtering on `n_name = 'FRANCE'` directly in the subquery `france_parts`, reducing the dataset size early.
- **Common Sub-expression Elimination**: The calculation of the threshold value is moved into a separate CTE (`threshold`), which is computed once and then used in the `HAVING` clause.
- **Use of Temporary Tables (CTEs)**: `france_parts` and `threshold` are used as temporary storage to simplify and speed up the main query execution.

These optimizations should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and by avoiding repeated calculations.
