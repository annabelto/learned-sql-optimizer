To further optimize the query, we need to consider additional strategies that might help in reducing the execution time. Here are some additional considerations:

1. **Index Utilization**: Ensure that indexes are used effectively, particularly on the join and filter columns.
2. **Materialized Subqueries**: If the subqueries are evaluated multiple times and the data does not change often, consider materializing the results temporarily.
3. **Columnar Storage**: If using a columnar storage format, ensure that only necessary columns are fetched.

Given the complexity of the query and the presence of subqueries that check for the existence and non-existence of certain conditions, let's attempt to optimize the query by ensuring efficient use of indexes and re-evaluating the join conditions.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT s_name, COUNT(*) AS numwait
FROM supplier
JOIN nation ON supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey AND nation.n_name = 'KENYA'
JOIN lineitem l1 ON supplier.s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey
JOIN orders ON l1.l_orderkey = orders.o_orderkey AND orders.o_orderstatus = 'F'
WHERE l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM lineitem l2
    WHERE l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
      AND l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
  )
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM lineitem l3
    WHERE l3.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
      AND l3.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
      AND l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate
  )
GROUP BY s_name
ORDER BY numwait DESC, s_name
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Changes Made:
- **Join Conditions**: Moved the conditions related to `nation.n_name` and `orders.o_orderstatus` directly into the `JOIN` clauses. This can help the database optimizer to reduce the number of rows early in the execution plan.
- **Index Recommendations**: Ensure that there are indexes on `nation.n_name`, `supplier.s_nationkey`, `lineitem.l_suppkey`, `lineitem.l_orderkey`, `orders.o_orderkey`, and `orders.o_orderstatus`. These indexes will help speed up the joins and the filtering conditions.
- **Subquery Optimization**: Kept the subqueries as they are necessary for the logic, but ensure that the `lineitem` table has appropriate indexes on `l_orderkey` and `l_suppkey` to make these checks efficient.

This version of the query aims to utilize indexes more effectively and reduce the number of rows processed by pushing join and filter conditions up in the execution plan.
