To further optimize the query and achieve better performance than the original, we need to focus on refining the execution strategy, particularly by ensuring optimal use of indexes and minimizing the data processed at each step. Given the slight performance difference, the optimization might involve subtle adjustments and a deeper understanding of the data distribution and existing indexes.

### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT c.c_custkey, c.c_name, SUM(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount)) as revenue, c.c_acctbal, n.n_name, c.c_address, c.c_phone, c.c_comment
FROM customer c
JOIN nation n ON c.c_nationkey = n.n_nationkey
JOIN orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
WHERE o.o_orderdate >= DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND o.o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '3' month
  AND l.l_returnflag = 'R'
GROUP BY c.c_custkey, c.c_name, c.c_acctbal, n.n_name, c.c_phone, c.c_address, c.c_comment
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Key Changes and Rationale:
1. **Maintain Original Join Order**: The join order is maintained as in the original query, starting with `customer` and `nation`, followed by `orders` and `lineitem`. This order is assumed to be optimal based on the original query's performance.
2. **Filter Placement**: Filters on `o_orderdate` and `l_returnflag` are placed in the `WHERE` clause to ensure they are applied after the joins, potentially leveraging indexes on these columns.
3. **Index Utilization**: The query assumes the presence of the following indexes:
   - `customer(c_custkey, c_nationkey)`
   - `nation(n_nationkey)`
   - `orders(o_custkey, o_orderdate)`
   - `lineitem(l_orderkey, l_returnflag)`

### Additional Recommendations:
- **Verify Indexes**: Ensure that the indexes mentioned are present and optimized for the query. Particularly, indexes on `o_orderdate` and `l_returnflag` should be checked for their effectiveness.
- **Analyze and Vacuum**: Regularly run `ANALYZE` and `VACUUM` on the tables to maintain statistics and optimize performance.
- **Execution Plan Review**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to review the execution plan and identify any potential bottlenecks.

This approach aims to optimize the join sequence and ensure that the most restrictive filters are applied early in the query execution process, leveraging the database's indexing capabilities effectively. If the performance does not improve, further analysis of the data distribution and index usage may be required.
