To optimize the given TPC-H query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. The rules include:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This involves moving filter conditions as close as possible to the data source. It reduces the number of rows processed in the subsequent stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, and if the filtering can be achieved through a subquery or a different condition, the join can be eliminated.

3. **Subquery Flattening**: This involves converting subqueries into joins where possible, which can be more efficient as it allows the optimizer more flexibility in reordering operations.

4. **Use of EXISTS instead of IN**: When checking for existence, EXISTS can be more efficient than IN because it stops processing as soon as it finds a match.

5. **Removing Redundant Operations**: Simplifying or removing operations that do not contribute to the final result.

### Applying the Rules:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: Push the conditions on `l_shipdate` and `p_name` closer to their respective tables in the subqueries.
2. **Subquery Flattening**: Convert the subquery that filters `partsupp` into a join.
3. **Use of EXISTS instead of IN**: Replace the IN subquery with an EXISTS clause for checking existence in `partsupp`.
4. **Removing Redundant Operations**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause is redundant as it does not limit the result set.

### Optimized Query:
```sql
SELECT s_name, s_address 
FROM supplier
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
WHERE n_name = 'FRANCE'
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN (
        SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, l_suppkey AS agg_suppkey, 0.5 * SUM(l_quantity) AS agg_quantity
        FROM lineitem
        WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' year
        GROUP BY l_partkey, l_suppkey
    ) agg_lineitem ON agg_partkey = ps_partkey AND agg_suppkey = ps_suppkey
    WHERE ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
    AND ps_availqty > agg_quantity
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM part
        WHERE p_partkey = ps_partkey AND p_name LIKE 'linen%'
    )
)
ORDER BY s_name;
```

This rewritten query uses joins and EXISTS clauses to potentially improve execution plans generated by the PostgreSQL query optimizer. The use of EXISTS helps in stopping the search as soon as a matching row is found, which can be more efficient than processing all matches as IN would.
