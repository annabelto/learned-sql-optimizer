To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the complexity and potentially improving the performance of the query. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates into subqueries to reduce the number of rows processed in the subqueries or joins.
2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not affect the result because it does not filter any rows or contribute to the output, it can be eliminated.
3. **Subquery Flattening**: This rule transforms correlated subqueries into joins or applies transformations to make the query more efficient.

### Original Query
```sql
SELECT s_name, s_address 
FROM supplier, nation 
WHERE s_suppkey IN (
    SELECT ps_suppkey 
    FROM partsupp, (
        SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, l_suppkey AS agg_suppkey, 0.5 * SUM(l_quantity) AS agg_quantity 
        FROM lineitem 
        WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
        AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR 
        GROUP BY l_partkey, l_suppkey
    ) agg_lineitem 
    WHERE agg_partkey = ps_partkey 
    AND agg_suppkey = ps_suppkey 
    AND ps_partkey IN (
        SELECT p_partkey 
        FROM part 
        WHERE p_name LIKE 'linen%'
    ) 
    AND ps_availqty > agg_quantity
) 
AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
AND n_name = 'FRANCE' 
ORDER BY s_name 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Step-by-Step Optimization

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
Push conditions on `part` and `lineitem` tables into the subquery to reduce the size of the join and the number of rows processed.

#### Step 2: Subquery Flattening
Flatten the subquery that calculates `agg_quantity` to join directly with `partsupp` and `part`, reducing the depth of subqueries and potentially allowing more efficient execution plans.

#### Optimized Query
```sql
SELECT s_name, s_address 
FROM supplier
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey 
WHERE n_name = 'FRANCE'
AND s_suppkey IN (
    SELECT ps_suppkey 
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN (
        SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, l_suppkey AS agg_suppkey, 0.5 * SUM(l_quantity) AS agg_quantity 
        FROM lineitem 
        WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-01-01' 
        AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01' + INTERVAL '1' YEAR 
        GROUP BY l_partkey, l_suppkey
    ) AS agg_lineitem ON agg_partkey = ps_partkey AND agg_suppkey = ps_suppkey
    JOIN part ON ps_partkey = p_partkey
    WHERE p_name LIKE 'linen%'
    AND ps_availqty > agg_quantity
)
ORDER BY s_name;
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Join Conditions**: Moved join conditions from the WHERE clause to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and potentially better optimization by the query planner.
- **Subquery Flattening**: The subquery for `lineitem` is joined directly with `partsupp` and `part`, reducing the nesting of subqueries.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions on `part` and `lineitem` are kept close to their respective tables to limit the number of rows early in the query processing.

These changes should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and by allowing the database engine to optimize the execution plan more effectively.
