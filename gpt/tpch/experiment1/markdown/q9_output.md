To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the amount of data processed and improve the execution plan. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (filters) closer to the data source. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be loaded and processed by filtering out rows as early as possible.

2. **Join Reordering**: This rule changes the order of joins to minimize the size of intermediate results. It can significantly reduce query execution time by joining smaller tables first.

3. **Projection Pushdown**: This rule moves projections (the selection of specific columns) closer to the data source. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed by carrying only the necessary columns through the query plan.

Here's the optimized query with explanations for each step:

```sql
SELECT 
    n_name AS nation, 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) AS o_year, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity) AS sum_profit
FROM 
    nation
JOIN 
    supplier ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
JOIN 
    partsupp ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
JOIN 
    lineitem ON ps_suppkey = l_suppkey AND ps_partkey = l_partkey AND o_orderkey = l_orderkey
JOIN 
    orders ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
JOIN 
    part ON p_partkey = l_partkey
WHERE 
    p_name LIKE '%white%'
GROUP BY 
    n_name, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate)
ORDER BY 
    n_name, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) DESC
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: The filter `p_name LIKE '%white%'` is applied directly in the `WHERE` clause, which reduces the number of rows processed in the joins and group by operations.
  
- **Join Reordering**: The joins have been reordered to start with `nation` and `supplier`, which are likely to have fewer rows after applying the `s_nationkey = n_nationkey` condition. This should reduce the size of intermediate results when joining with other tables.

- **Projection Pushdown**: Only the necessary columns for the final result are selected in the main query block, reducing the amount of data carried through the execution plan.

These optimizations should make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and by using a more efficient join order. The exact performance gain can depend on the specific database schema, indexes, and data distribution.
