To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the complexity and improving the performance of the query. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates as close as possible to the data source. It helps in reducing the number of rows early in the execution plan, which can significantly improve performance.

2. **Conjunction Splitting**: This rule splits complex predicates connected by OR into separate queries that can be independently optimized and then recombined, if necessary.

3. **Simplifying Expressions**: Simplify expressions where possible to make the query more readable and potentially optimize execution.

Here's the optimized query using PostgreSQL syntax:

```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM (
    SELECT l_extendedprice, l_discount
    FROM lineitem
    JOIN part ON p_partkey = l_partkey
    WHERE p_brand = 'Brand#53'
      AND p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')
      AND l_quantity BETWEEN 10 AND 20
      AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5
      AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
      AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT l_extendedprice, l_discount
    FROM lineitem
    JOIN part ON p_partkey = l_partkey
    WHERE p_brand = 'Brand#32'
      AND p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
      AND l_quantity BETWEEN 13 AND 23
      AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10
      AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
      AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT l_extendedprice, l_discount
    FROM lineitem
    JOIN part ON p_partkey = l_partkey
    WHERE p_brand = 'Brand#41'
      AND p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')
      AND l_quantity BETWEEN 23 AND 33
      AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15
      AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
      AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
) AS subquery;
```

### Explanation of Applied Rules:

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Applied to move the conditions on `p_brand`, `p_container`, `l_quantity`, `p_size`, `l_shipmode`, and `l_shipinstruct` directly into the subqueries where the tables `lineitem` and `part` are joined. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed in the outer query.

- **Conjunction Splitting**: The original query had three separate conditions combined with OR. Each condition is now handled in its own subquery, allowing each to be optimized separately.

- **Simplifying Expressions**: The range conditions for `l_quantity` were simplified from `l_quantity >= X AND l_quantity <= X + 10` to `l_quantity BETWEEN X AND X + 10`.

This optimized query should perform better than the original by reducing the number of rows processed and by using `UNION ALL` to combine results from independently optimized subqueries. Each subquery can potentially use indexes effectively (if available) on the `part` and `lineitem` tables for the `JOIN` and `WHERE` clause conditions.
