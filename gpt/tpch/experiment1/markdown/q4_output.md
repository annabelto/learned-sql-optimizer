To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without changing the semantics of the query. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (conditions) into subqueries or joins when possible, to reduce the number of rows processed early in the execution plan. In this case, we can push the condition related to `o_orderkey` from the `EXISTS` subquery into a join condition, which can potentially allow the use of indexes and reduce the number of rows scanned.

2. **Remove Redundant LIMIT**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause in PostgreSQL effectively means no limit. Since this is the default behavior when no LIMIT clause is specified, we can remove this clause to simplify the query.

3. **Use Explicit JOINs**: Convert the implicit join in the `EXISTS` subquery to an explicit `INNER JOIN`. This can make better use of indexes and is generally more readable and preferred in SQL for expressing joins.

Here is the optimized query with the applied rules:

### Optimized Query.
```sql
SELECT o.o_orderpriority, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
WHERE o.o_orderdate >= DATE '1996-01-01'
  AND o.o_orderdate < DATE '1996-01-01' + INTERVAL '3 months'
  AND l.l_commitdate < l.l_receiptdate
GROUP BY o.o_orderpriority
ORDER BY o.o_orderpriority;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Predicate Pushdown and JOIN Conversion**: The `EXISTS` subquery was converted to an `INNER JOIN` on `lineitem` using the condition `l_orderkey = o_orderkey`. This allows the database to limit the rows from both `orders` and `lineitem` tables early in the query processing based on the join condition and the additional filters.
- **Removed `LIMIT ALL`**: This clause was removed as it is redundant.
- **Date Interval Syntax**: Ensured the interval addition to the date is clear and correct as per PostgreSQL syntax.

These changes should make the query more efficient by reducing the number of rows processed and potentially utilizing indexes more effectively.
