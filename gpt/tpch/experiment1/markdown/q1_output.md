To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply a combination of data-independent rewrite rules that focus on simplifying and restructuring the query without changing its semantics. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves the filter as close as possible to the data source. In this query, the filter on `l_shipdate` is already at the base table, so no action is needed here.

2. **Eliminate Redundant LIMIT**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause in SQL is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned; it essentially means no limit. Removing this clause simplifies the query without affecting its functionality.

3. **Simplify Expressions**: The expressions inside the aggregate functions can be simplified or rewritten for clarity or performance, but in this case, they are already quite optimized for the given operations.

4. **Remove Redundant Ordering**: If the query's results are only used internally and not displayed, and if the order does not affect subsequent operations, the `ORDER BY` clause could be removed to improve performance. However, if the order of results is required for display or further processing, this step should be skipped. For this optimization, I'll assume the order is necessary.

After applying these rules, the optimized query in PostgreSQL syntax is:

### Optimized Query.
```sql
SELECT 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus, 
    SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price, 
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge, 
    AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty, 
    AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price, 
    AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc, 
    COUNT(*) AS count_order 
FROM 
    lineitem 
WHERE 
    l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '70 day' 
GROUP BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus 
ORDER BY 
    l_returnflag, 
    l_linestatus;
```

### Summary of Applied Rules:
- **Eliminate Redundant LIMIT**: Removed `LIMIT ALL` as it is redundant.
- The other potential optimizations (like removing `ORDER BY` or further simplifying expressions) were considered but not applied, as they might affect the output or are already optimal.

This query is now slightly simplified by removing the unnecessary `LIMIT` clause, and it maintains the same functionality and output structure as the original.
