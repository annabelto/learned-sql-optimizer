To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that improve the performance without altering the result. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (filters) closer to the data source. It reduces the number of rows early in the execution plan, which can significantly decrease the amount of data processed and transferred in later stages.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join does not contribute to the final result beyond filtering, it can sometimes be eliminated or simplified.

3. **Subquery Optimization**: Transforming correlated subqueries into more efficient forms, such as using a join or applying an aggregate function directly in the main query.

Here's the optimized query with explanations for each step:

```sql
SELECT s_acctbal, s_name, n_name, p_partkey, p_mfgr, s_address, s_phone, s_comment
FROM part
JOIN partsupp ON p_partkey = ps_partkey
JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey
WHERE p_size = 16
  AND p_type LIKE '%NICKEL'
  AND r_name = 'EUROPE'
  AND ps_supplycost = (
    SELECT MIN(ps_supplycost)
    FROM partsupp
    JOIN supplier ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
    JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey
    WHERE r_name = 'EUROPE'
  )
ORDER BY s_acctbal DESC, n_name, s_name, p_partkey
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Applied Rules and Explanation:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: 
   - The conditions `p_size = 16`, `p_type LIKE '%NICKEL'`, and `r_name = 'EUROPE'` are pushed down immediately in the `WHERE` clause. This reduces the number of rows processed in the joins and the subquery.
   - In the subquery, the condition `r_name = 'EUROPE'` is also pushed down to reduce the dataset early.

2. **Join Elimination**: 
   - Not explicitly applied here as all joins contribute to the final result set by providing necessary columns or by being part of the filtering conditions.

3. **Subquery Optimization**:
   - The subquery is optimized by ensuring it only computes the minimum `ps_supplycost` for the relevant region and supplier, avoiding unnecessary computations over the entire dataset.

4. **Ordering and Limit**:
   - The `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT ALL` clauses are maintained as they are crucial for the final result ordering and presentation. `LIMIT ALL` is effectively the same as omitting the LIMIT clause, as it does not limit the number of rows returned.

This optimized query should perform better due to reduced data scanning and processing, especially with the pushed-down predicates and efficient handling of the subquery.
