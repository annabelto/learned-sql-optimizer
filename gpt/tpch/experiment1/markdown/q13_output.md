To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply a series of data-independent rewrite rules that focus on simplifying and restructuring the query without changing its semantics. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Pushing Predicates**: Move the predicate filtering (`o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'`) closer to the data source to reduce the number of rows early in the processing. This can reduce the amount of data that needs to be joined and grouped.

2. **Eliminate Redundant LIMIT**: The `LIMIT ALL` clause in SQL is redundant because it does not limit the number of rows returned. Removing it simplifies the query.

3. **Simplifying Subquery Aliasing**: The subquery aliasing is verbose and can be simplified for clarity without changing the functionality.

Here is the optimized query with explanations for each step:

### Original Query
```sql
select c_count, count(*) as custdist
from (
    select c_custkey, count(o_orderkey)
    from customer
    left outer join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
    group by c_custkey
) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by c_count
order by custdist desc, c_count desc
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Optimized Query
```sql
-- Applying Predicate Pushing and Eliminating Redundant LIMIT
select c_count, count(*) as custdist
from (
    select c_custkey, count(o_orderkey) as c_count
    from customer
    left outer join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey
    where o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%' or o_comment is null
    group by c_custkey
) as c_orders
group by c_count
order by custdist desc, c_count desc;
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Predicate Pushing**: The condition `o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'` is moved into a `WHERE` clause after the `LEFT OUTER JOIN`. This is valid because the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` preserves all rows from the `customer` table, and the condition is applied to the `orders` table. Note that we must consider `NULL` values in `o_comment` which are naturally included in a left join when there's no matching row in `orders`.
  
- **Eliminate Redundant LIMIT**: Removed `LIMIT ALL` as it does not affect the result.

- **Simplifying Subquery Aliasing**: The subquery output column `count(o_orderkey)` is directly named `c_count` in the subquery, removing the need for additional aliasing in the subquery definition.

These changes make the query more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed and simplifying the query structure without altering the result set.
