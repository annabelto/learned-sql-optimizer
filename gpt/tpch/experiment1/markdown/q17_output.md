To optimize the given SQL query, we can apply several data-independent rewrite rules that help in reducing the amount of data processed and the complexity of the operations. Here are the steps and rules applied:

1. **Predicate Pushdown**: This rule moves predicates (filters) as close as possible to the data source. By applying filters early, we reduce the number of rows that need to be processed in later stages of the query.

2. **Join Elimination**: If a join operation does not contribute additional columns or affects the result, it can be eliminated.

3. **Redundant Join Elimination**: If the same table is joined multiple times on the same keys, redundant joins can be eliminated.

Here's the original query:
```sql
SELECT sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly
FROM lineitem, part, 
     (SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 0.2 * avg(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity 
      FROM lineitem 
      GROUP BY l_partkey) part_agg 
WHERE p_partkey = l_partkey 
  AND agg_partkey = l_partkey 
  AND p_brand = 'Brand#41' 
  AND p_container = 'WRAP BAG' 
  AND l_quantity < avg_quantity 
LIMIT ALL;
```

### Step-by-Step Optimization:

#### Step 1: Predicate Pushdown
Push the predicates related to `part` table (`p_brand` and `p_container`) closer to where the table is scanned:
```sql
FROM lineitem, 
     (SELECT * FROM part WHERE p_brand = 'Brand#41' AND p_container = 'WRAP BAG') AS filtered_part, 
     (SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 0.2 * avg(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity 
      FROM lineitem 
      GROUP BY l_partkey) part_agg 
```

#### Step 2: Redundant Join Elimination
The join between `lineitem` and `part_agg` is redundant because `part_agg` is derived from `lineitem` and they are joined on `l_partkey` which is the same as `agg_partkey`. We can eliminate this by ensuring the derived table `part_agg` already filters based on the conditions applied later:
```sql
FROM lineitem, 
     (SELECT * FROM part WHERE p_brand = 'Brand#41' AND p_container = 'WRAP BAG') AS filtered_part, 
     (SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 0.2 * avg(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity 
      FROM lineitem 
      WHERE l_quantity < (SELECT 0.2 * avg(l_quantity) FROM lineitem WHERE l_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey)
      GROUP BY l_partkey) part_agg 
```

### Optimized Query.
```sql
SELECT sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly
FROM lineitem
JOIN (SELECT * FROM part WHERE p_brand = 'Brand#41' AND p_container = 'WRAP BAG') AS filtered_part
  ON filtered_part.p_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey
JOIN (SELECT l_partkey AS agg_partkey, 0.2 * avg(l_quantity) AS avg_quantity 
      FROM lineitem 
      GROUP BY l_partkey
      HAVING l_quantity < (SELECT 0.2 * avg(l_quantity) FROM lineitem WHERE l_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey)) part_agg 
  ON part_agg.agg_partkey = lineitem.l_partkey;
```

### Explanation:
- **Predicate Pushdown** was used to filter rows in the `part` table early in the process.
- **Redundant Join Elimination** was applied to remove unnecessary joins by ensuring that the derived table `part_agg` already includes the necessary filtering logic.

This optimized query should perform better as it reduces the amount of data being joined and processes filters earlier in the execution plan.
